<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">When</span> Miss Huntington told me last
year that she was going to write a
book about the trees in their winter
aspects, knowing how conscientiously she had
studied her subject and how successful she
had been in imparting the results of her observation
to others, I felt sure that she would
do a useful and excellent piece of work, and
that her book would be of real assistance to
all persons who want to gain some knowledge
of the trees which they pass in their daily
walks.</p>

<p>The promise of the book is now fulfilled, and
nothing is left for the introductor to do but to
call attention in a general way to the beauty
of trees in winter and to the pleasure and
profit of studying them at this season of the
year, as well as when their branches are
clothed with leaves or covered with flowers
or fruits.</p>

<p>To the real lover of trees they are equally
beautiful and interesting at all seasons of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</span>
year; and no one knows trees well who cannot
distinguish the different species as easily and
surely in winter as in spring or summer.
Almost every tree has some special and peculiar
beauty which is seen to the best advantage
in winter. The fine spray of the beech is
seen only at this season of the year, and there
are few more beautiful objects in nature than
the delicate branches of our New England
beech trees seen against the clear blue sky
of a brilliant winter day. The sturdiness of
the oak is best realized in winter, for at other
seasons its massive limbs are often hidden
under their covering of leaves. The birch is
far more graceful and attractive in winter than
at any other period; and there is nothing more
stimulating to the lover of nature than to
stand on a bright winter’s day and look up
into the marvellous structure of one of the
great elm trees which are the pride of New
England. The bark of most trees appears
more beautiful in winter than at other seasons
of the year because the eye, undisturbed
by the contemplation of the foliage, can then
most easily take in all the details of its varied
texture and wonderful colors.</p>

<p>For the student of trees searching for accurate
knowledge it is as important to study<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</span>
trees in winter as in summer. The differences
in the various families of trees, once these are
understood, are marked enough to make family
relationships easy to recognize at this season of
the year. Nor will it be found difficult, once
the characters peculiar to each kind of tree are
fixed in the mind of the observer, to determine
the various species; and these winter characters
are often more constant and stable than
characters derived from the flowers, the shape
of the leaves, or from the size and shape of the
fruits, on which dependence is usually placed
for the identification of trees.</p>

<p>Each species of tree has its peculiar habit,
which is best seen in winter and which it
usually retains under normal conditions. The
character of the bark rarely changes much on
individuals of the same age, although the bark
of old trees is usually very different from the
bark of young trees of the same species; and
the color of the branchlets and the form and
size of the winter buds generally afford certain
means of determining closely related trees.</p>

<p>In each kind of tree there is, in addition to
its general habit, which with a little practice is
frequently sufficient to make the recognition of
a particular species easy, some special character
which enables the student to confirm his determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</span>
and to distinguish a particular species
of oak or hickory or poplar from every other.</p>

<p>A knowledge of trees, the ability at least to
recognize and identify them, adds vastly to the
pleasures of life. One who knows trees well
meets them like old friends; each season invests
them with fresh charm, and the more we
study and know them the greater will be our
admiration of the wonderful variety and beauty
which they display in winter.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE STUDY OF TREES IN WINTER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Outside</span> my window the trees in a
little wood stand leafless. Everything
which made this wood a delight in
June, the contrast of light and shade among
the leaves, the varying tones of green in broken
sunlight, the warmth and color and summer
freshness, has gone, but the trees themselves,
in all their wealth of foliage were never so
beautiful as now. The massive moulding of
their trunks, the graceful curves of their
branches, the fine tracery of their little bare
twigs, now clear against the sky and again lost
in a tangled network of intersecting branches,—the
whole beauty of their symmetry, their
poise, strength, and delicacy is revealed as it
is never revealed in summer.</p>

<p>Attracted first by the obvious grace of the
forms of trees as we see them from our windows
in winter, we discover that a closer study of the
details of bare twigs and buds in the woods
discloses unsuspected beauty in texture, form,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</span>
and color. Each tree has definite traits of its
own which distinguish it from every other tree,
and by tracing individual characteristics in the
branches, trunk, stems, buds, and leaf-scars we
are able to identify every tree with certainty.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Trunk and
Branches</div>

TRUNK</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By observing the shapes and general
outlines of trees in winter
we are able to recognize them at
a distance. This study of tree forms adds much
to the pleasure of a railroad journey or a winter’s
drive in the
country, and accuracy
is acquired
by constant practice
when we walk
in the woods and
fields and can
verify the name
of each tree. In
this way we become
familiar
with the common
trees, and learn
to know the predominating trees
of the forests through which we pass, often
recognizing a rare species the distance of a
field away.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p5004p" style="max-width: 40em;">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">Cross section of a tree trunk, showing the rings of annual growth, the medullary

</figure>
<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</span></p>

<p>There are two distinct plans of branching in
trees. When the main trunk extends upward to
the tip, as it does in the
larch and other conical
trees, it is said to
be <em>excurrent</em>, and when
the main stem divides
into many more or
less equal divisions,
as we find it in
the American
elm and other
spreading trees,
it is said to be
<em>deliquescent</em>,—the
latter form
is the most common
one among
our deciduous
trees.</p>

<figure class="figright illowp45" id="i_p5005" style="max-width: 47.0625em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p5005.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">TREE WITH AN EXCURRENT TRUNK</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The inner structure of these dicotyledonous
trunks is seen when we examine the cross
section cut of a felled tree. In the centre
is the heartwood, the durable wood of commercial
value, the cells of which are hard and
dry; next it the soft sapwood, the living part
of the tree containing cells filled with sap; then
the cambium layer, the zone of growing cells,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
and outside of this the bark. Each year new
cells are formed in the cambium layer, the inner
ones making new wood, the outer ones new
bark, and by counting these annual rings of
growth the approximate age of the tree is found.
In young trees there is a conspicuous central
portion of pith which remains after the tree
matures, as long as the heartwood is sound.
The lines radiating from the centre to the
circumference are called medullary or pith
rays and form the “silver grain” of the wood.
As the size of the trunk increases, the bark unable
to expand, cracks in fissures or peels in
layers, and is pushed off by the tremendous
growing power from within. The heartwood
is not a living part of the structure and often
trees live for years without it,—hollow shells
with a normal amount of vitality so long as the
roots, the cambium layer and the buds are not
injured.</p>

<p>Branches grow from the axillary or lateral
buds on the stem, continuing their growth
every year by the development and unfolding
of new buds, both terminal and lateral. When
the growth is carried on by the terminal buds,
the tree is more apt to be regular in outline than
when these are injured or killed and lateral
buds develop the growth instead. Branches<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
vary in showing an upright, drooping, or horizontal
habit of growth, as we see them in the
Lombardy poplar, weeping willow and tupelo,
and within these divisions there are other contrasts
of rigidity and flexibility, with differences
of color and texture as well.</p>

<p>Apart from the general shape of the tree, the
bark on the trunk and branches is a constant
help in identification. It is hard and smooth
on some trees, like that of the hornbeam and
beech, fissured into ridges like the sugar maple
on others, it sometimes flakes off in rough plates
like those of the shagbark hickory, and again in
thin, brittle strips like those of the hop hornbeam,
the bark peels off laterally as in the canoe
birch, and occasionally becomes ridged and
corky as we find it on the branches of the
liquidamber and cork elm. Very often the
color of the bark is distinctive as is that of
the green stems of the sassafras and moosewood
maple and the white, brown, pink, and
yellow trunks of different birches. The taste
and odor of the bark are also characteristic of
certain species, as, for instance, the unpleasant,
bitter taste of the black cherry, the mucilaginous
taste of the slippery elm, and the aromatic
fragrance of the stems of the mockernut hickory.
The little dots on young bark are called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
<em>lenticels</em>, they are openings for admitting air
to the inner tissues. Lenticels are conspicuous
in the bark of the birches.</p>

<p>The presence of thorns on the trunk and
branches of certain trees helps us to distinguish
them from others, and the clusters of
dry fruit which remain hanging on some trees
through the winter are another means of identification.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stems and
Twigs</div>

<p>Stems and twigs vary from the
finest, lightest sprays to the most
coarsely moulded ones,—from the delicate twigs
of the hop hornbeam to the stout shoots of
the horsechestnut;—like larger branches their
tips either ascend, droop, or grow at right
angles from the stem, and may be smooth,
downy, or rough to the touch.</p>

<p>The pith in cross sections of twigs shows
different forms and is a means in itself of distinguishing
some trees. It is usually circular,
but in some species it takes the form of a
pentagon or a star. In a vertical section we
sometimes find it in horizontal plates, like the
chambered pith of the walnuts. The color is
usually white, but sometimes we find it pink,
yellowish, green, red, and brown.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find that the history of a
tree for several years past can be told by studying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
the scars along the bare stems. The annual
growth each year is marked by a circle
of scars around the stem, which was left by
the scales of the buds when they opened
in the spring, and these scars mark each
season’s growth for successive years along
the stem.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Leaf-scars</div>

<p>Besides these circles of scars, there
are scars on each side of the stem
which were left by the leaves when they fell in
the autumn. These leaf-scars differ distinctly
in various species and may be round, narrow, triangular,
oval, heart-shaped, or horseshoe-shaped
according to the species of the tree. They are
either flat upon the stem or on a projection, they
are sometimes concave and again convex. They
may be opposite each other on the stem, as those
of the horsechestnut, maples, and ashes, or the
arrangement may be alternate, as that of hickories,
walnuts and oaks. The places on the stem
where the leaf-scars appear are called <em>nodes</em>, and
the spaces between the nodes are called <em>internodes</em>.</p>

<p>Occasionally stipule scars are found on the
stems,—inconspicuous scars left by stipules,
the leaf-like bodies found at the base of leafstalks
on some trees,—and sometimes we find
the scars of fruit stalks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Bundle-scars</div>

<figure class="figleft illowp15" id="i_p5010" style="max-width: 9.25em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p5010.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent fs90">BUNDLE-SCARS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Bundle-scars are the scars of the
little fibres, the vascular bundles
which fastened the leaves to the stems
in summer. They are found on the
leaf-scars and usually take their shape
more or less. On the large leaf-scars
they can be seen clearly, but on delicate
twigs where the leaf-scars are small it
is well to use a magnifying glass.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buds</div>

<p>In our climate the buds of trees
are formed in the summer during
the season’s growth. The bud at the tip
of the stem is called the <em>terminal</em> bud, the
buds in the axils of the leaf-scars are called
the <em>axillary</em> or <em>lateral</em> buds. Buds contain
complete branches in miniature which develop
in the spring into a new crop of twigs.
By opening a bud in winter the little leaves
can be seen and often a cluster of flowers,
packed away from the cold in marvellous warm
wrappings.</p>

<p>As a rule the terminal bud carries on the
growth of the tree and the lateral buds furnish
the side branches. Flowers are found in both
terminal and lateral buds, but sometimes they
are enclosed in buds by themselves which
open before the leaves come out in the spring,
like those of the red maple and American elm,—these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
are called <em>flower</em> buds. Occasionally
we find two or three lateral buds together
called <em>accessory</em> buds,—<em>superposed</em>, if placed
one above another as they are in the butternut;
<em>collateral</em>, if side by side as in the red
maple. When several buds are crowded together
one bud usually remains latent. Latent
buds are sometimes caught in the growing
bark of the tree and remain undeveloped for
years, breaking out at length perhaps up and
down the sides of the trunk as we see them
in “feathered elms.” These abnormal and
irregular buds are called <em>adventitious</em> buds.</p>

<p>The winter buds of trees may be large or
small, they may be slender, flat, oval, pointed
or round, hidden or exposed, they may be
smooth, downy, sticky, or rough, covered with
scales or naked, and they may differ in color
from pale yellow to an inky black.</p>

<p>From the great outlines of the trees against
the sky to the little scales of the buds on the
stems we marvel to find here as in all nature,
order, law, consistency out of infinite variety.</p>

</div>

<h3>Family Hippocastanaceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">This</span> a small family consisting of one
well-known cultivated species,—the
horsechestnut,—and four belonging
to the Western and Southern States,—the
various large and small buckeyes.</p>

<p>The horsechestnut is so well known and its
winter characteristics so clearly marked that I
have chosen it first for description, although
no species of the family is found growing wild
in the Northeastern States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Horsechestnut

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æsculus hippocastanum</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree with a pyramidal
head. The bark of old trees
splits off in small square pieces,
and in young trees it is smooth.
Very coarse twigs and large brown buds covered
with a gummy substance. Opposite leaf-scars.</em></p>

<p>The horsechestnut has little grace or beauty
of outline in winter. Its branches are stiff,
the twigs are coarse, ending bluntly with large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
terminal buds, and the general shape too compact
to be pleasing. The buds and recent
shoots are particularly interesting however, as
every scar is sharply defined and the buds are
so large we can see the inner structure perfectly.
In the accompanying illustration we
see a two-year-old shoot with a large terminal
bud and two lateral buds below the ring of
scars left by the scales of the terminal bud of
the year before. The bundle-scars are plainly
seen on the leaf-scars, and above one of the
leaf-scars there is a lateral bud ready to develop
into a lateral branch when it opens in the
spring. The circle of scars at the base of each
lateral shoot was left by the scales of the
lateral bud of the year before. There are one
or two small undeveloped buds at the top of
the leaf-scars which would carry on the growth
of the branch if anything happened to injure
the vigorous buds at the tips of the stems.
The dots on the bark are the lenticels. By
opening the bud with a knife we find beneath
the sticky gummy substance and the numerous
layers of scales a complete branch in miniature.
The little leaves are carefully packed in downy
wool to keep out the dampness and cold, and
in their turn they protect the delicate pink
spike of flowers. A German naturalist once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>counted sixty-eight flowers on one of these
undeveloped spikes in the bud, and with a
microscope he discovered the pollen of the
stamens.</p>

<p>The horsechestnut came originally from
Southeastern Europe and was introduced into
gardens about the middle of the sixteenth
century. Its wood has no commercial value.
The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æsculus</i>, comes from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">esca</i>,
food, the ancient name of an oak with edible
acorns; it was probably given to this tree on
account of its large chestnut-like fruit. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hippocastanum</i>,
from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hippos</i>, a horse, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castanea</i>, a
chestnut, alludes to the fruit which is made
into horse medicine in Turkey.</p>

<p>The Ohio buckeye (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Æsculus glabra</i>) is a
shrub or low tree found west of the Alleghanies.
Its terminal bud is frequently lacking,
and the two upper lateral buds grow large and
take its place. Its buds and stems resemble
those of the horsechestnut, but the two species
would never be confused.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE MAPLES</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Family Aceraceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Maples</span> have long been famous for
beauty of blossom in the early spring,
and richness of foliage in the late
summer and autumn; but a study of the twigs
and buds after the leaves have fallen, the varying
colors of buds and stems, the delicacy
of twigs and branches, and grace of outline
as trees demonstrates effectively the unusual
beauty of the maples in winter.</p>

<p>The family name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer</i> comes from the Latin
word for sharp, which was originally derived
from <em>ac</em>, a Celtic word meaning a point. The
name was given to this genus because the wood
was much sought after in ancient times for the
heads of pikes and lances.</p>

<p>Among some forty species of maple there are
six native species, if the ash-leaved maple is
included in this genus. Two species from
Europe, the Norway and sycamore maples, are
planted commonly throughout New England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span></p>

<p>All the maples have opposite leaf-scars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sugar or Rock
Maple

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer saccharum</i></div>

<p><em>The general shape is erect, with
smooth, clean branches. In old
trees the bark breaks away in
long, shallow fissures with curling ridges, giving
the trunk a ploughed appearance. The buds
are narrow, brown, and sharp-pointed. Delicate
pinkish leaves folded inside the bud. Leaf-scars
small and opposite; also the twigs branch
opposite each other.</em></p>

<p>Among the different characteristics of this
tree in winter, two stand out conspicuously as
unfailing means of identification,—the sharp-pointed
brown buds and the rough furrowed
trunk with smooth places between the fissures.
When young it can be distinguished at a distance
by its erect habit of growth and general
shapeliness, the main trunk often extending up
into the tree unbroken by divisions.</p>

<br>

<p>The sugar maple is typically American, and
is especially associated in our minds with the
farming and country life of New England. It
is found in all the Northeastern States growing
wild and extensively cultivated. Maple sugar
is made from the sap of this tree in the early
spring. A clear, bright day and a westerly
wind succeeding a frosty night are most favorable
to the flow of sap, according to Emerson.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span>A hole is bored in the trunk of the tree,
and the sap flows for about three weeks. It
is collected daily in buckets, and then boiled
into syrup. A sugar maple should not be
tapped before it is twenty-five or thirty years
old, but after that age it may be tapped annually
as long as it lives. The wood of this
tree is hard and smooth, and is much used for
furniture and the interior finishing of houses.
Occasionally a tree is found where the fibres
of the wood are contorted irregularly into
round points called bird’s eyes. The cause of
this peculiar bird’s-eye maple is unknown, and
the theory that the grain is diverted by the tapping
of woodpeckers for the sweet sap is an
unsatisfactory explanation, for some trees are
thickly covered, while others do not have a
single spot.</p>

<p>The Latin name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer saccharum</i>—sugar
maple—came from the Arabic, <em>Soukar</em>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Red or Swamp
Maple

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer rubrum</i></div>

<p><em>A low tree, with a rounded head,
smooth gray bark, reddish twigs
dotted with brown, and small,
round red buds with smooth scales. When old
the bark cracks and peels off in long, slender
flakes. Small leaf-scars opposite each other on the
stem. The flowers come before the leaves, from
the round flower buds clustered around the stem.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span></p>

<p>Even in the middle of winter the red maple
is true to its distinctive characteristic of color,
and one marvels to find so much red in its
buds and twigs. The gray trunks are in fine
contrast, and accentuate the color, and the
curving tips of the branches, with their delicate
twigs and graceful outlines, give the trees great
beauty.</p>

<p>The red maple is one of the very first trees
to bloom in the early spring, and then its
color is conspicuous, for, as Lowell says, it
“crimsons to a coral reef.” The flowers are
sweet scented, and the carrying of pollen is
done on a wholesale plan over the tree by little,
inconspicuous insects, which carry the pollen
dust from flower to flower.</p>

<br>

<p>In the autumn this tree is one of the first to
turn, and its brilliant red leaves in the low
swamp lands, beginning often the last of August
or early September, invariably startle one
with a swift premonition of winter. “How
early the fall has come this year!” some one
usually says, and no one realizes it is just the
habit of early maturity peculiar to that particular
red maple. It is a tree closely associated
with Thoreau, for we read that he spent much
time in extracting sugar from its sap, against
the wishes of his more practical-minded father,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>who could not understand why his son should
spend time and money over such an experiment,
when he could buy better and cheaper
sugar at the store.</p>

<p>The wood, although it is close-grained and
firm, is not so much used as that of the sugar
maple, owing to the fact that it decays when
exposed to alternate moisture and dryness.
There are several varieties of the wood. The
curled maple, one of the most attractive, has
wavy fibres which catch the light like watered
silk, and it is much used in cabinet work. The
sap is only half as rich in sugar as that of the
sugar maple.</p>

<p>The Latin name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer rubrum</i>,—red maple,—came
from the Celtic word <em>rub</em>, signifying red.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White or Silver
Maple

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer saccharinum</i></div>

<p><em>This tree is found growing wild
in wet places throughout New
England, and it is also often
cultivated. The trunk is low and divided into
spreading branches that form a spacious head.
The branches sweep down and turn up with
curving tips. Smooth, red buds like those of
the red maple. It blossoms before the leaves
are out, like the red maple.</em></p>

<p>It is always a delight to find this tree growing
naturally where it has not been planted,
for, owing to its habit of growing near flowing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
streams with clear, sandy bottoms, one rarely
comes across it. It is a tree to look for on a
canoeing trip, and when one discovers its long,
drooping branches hanging over the stream,
the feeling of isolation is complete; a silver
maple on a river bank accentuates the sense of
being in the country, just as the notes of the
hermit thrush accentuate the sense of remoteness
in the woods.</p>

<p>In winter there are two distinct characteristics
by which one may distinguish the silver
maple from the red which it closely resembles,—the
curving tips of the lower branches
which sweep down and curve up in a pronounced
way unlike the red maple, and the
manner in which the bark peels off from the
old trunks, in long pieces which are free
at either end and attached in the middle,
while the bark of the red maple splits up
and down the trunk without shagging in
strips.</p>

<p>The wood of the silver maple is soft and
perishable and is seldom used.</p>

<p>The former name of this tree was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer
dasycarpum</i>, but it has been changed to <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer
saccharinum</i>, the old name for the sugar maple,—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer
saccharum</i>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Striped Maple;
Moosewood

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer pennsylvanicum</i></div>

<p><em>A small tree, with smooth green
shoots and a light green bark
striped with white. The leaf-scars
are opposite, and encircle the stem, and
are conspicuously ridged, with two raised lines
above. Smooth bud-scales, silver white leaves
folded within the bud.</em></p>

<p>The moosewood is a beautiful little tree at
all times, but in winter when its large leaves
have fallen and the wonderful coloring of its
trunk and stems is no longer concealed by
foliage, one can fully appreciate its color, delicate
branches and smooth stems. The trunk
is an exquisite shade of green, smooth, with
occasional stripes of white, and the stems and
buds are also smooth and a rich rose in
color.</p>

<p>This tree is too small for practical use, but
its æsthetic qualities should cause it to be
more generally planted in our parks and
gardens than it is.</p>

<p>The name moosewood was given to it by
the country people in Maine, as the moose in
the woods invariably strip it for the sweet
juice in the tender young shoots in winter,
when there is little for them to eat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</span></p>

<p>The Latin name <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer pennsylvanicum</i>—Pennsylvanian
maple—was given to it by
Linnæus.</p>

<p>The moosewood is found throughout the
North Atlantic States growing in rich woods
under taller trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mountain

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer spicatum</i></div>

<p>This is a shrub about eight feet
high, found commonly in the
mountains and hills of New England,
and like the moosewood seldom found
growing out of the forest. It is easily distinguished
by its gray bark and pink stems
covered with a delicate gray bloom, and the
clusters of dried fruit left hanging on the
stems.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer spicatum</i>—spiked maple—refers to
the spike-like clusters of flowers.</p>

<p>This tree is found wild in Vermont and
Pennsylvania, southward and westward in lowland

throughout New England.</p>

<p>It is not long-lived and has small practical
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>value, as the wood is not strong, and the sap
yields only a small quantity of sugar.</p>

<p>The Latin name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">negundo</i>, is meaningless
and its origin is unknown.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Norway Maple

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Acer platanoides</i></div>

<p><em>A tall tree, with a round head
and closely fissured bark. The
buds are large, round, and a dull reddish brown
color. Coarse twigs and opposite leaf-scars.
Distinctive characteristic is the white juice
which comes after cutting off a bud.</em></p>

<p>It is particularly interesting to open the buds
of this tree, and to see how carefully the leaves
are protected. After removing the outer scales
of the terminal bud with a knife, one discovers
a pair of scales covered with soft brown hair
as thick as sealskin fur and the same color.
Within this warm covering there are still
another pair of inner scales with fur a little
darker and thicker than that of the first pair,
and within these are the little leaves in embryo.
In some buds one finds a tiny flower cluster
instead, so small it can scarcely be seen, but
perfect in every detail,—the most protected of
flowers. A discovery like this makes one wonder
if the dispensation of coverings is erratically
bestowed, for why should we find a rugged,
stalwart tree like the Norway maple with its
buds luxuriously protected from the cold, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
a slender, delicate tree like our moosewood
has only a pair of scales for a bud-covering?
There must be hidden vitality in the little
moosewood, for in spring, when the leaves
come out, they are as vigorous and beautiful as
those of the Norway maple; perhaps, after all,
it is just a matter of nationality; the Norway
maple came from Europe and has kept the
traditional custom of wearing warm clothing
in winter, and the moosewood has lived without
superfluous raiment, like an Indian in the
woods.</p>

<p>Sugar has been made from the sap of the
Norway maple, but it is produced in small
quantity. The wood is easily worked, and is
used in Europe for various small purposes.</p>

it is found here commonly planted in gardens

<p>It is distinguished from all other maples in
winter by its unvarying green buds, and the
manner in which the bark of old trees breaks
off in thin, small, square pieces.</p>

<p>It is a favorite Scotch tree and was much
planted about old estates in Scotland. Over
two hundred years ago, the powerful barons in
the West of Scotland used these sycamores for
hanging their enemies and refractory vassals on,
and these trees were called dool, or grief trees.
Loudon tells the romantic histories of several
dool trees which were still standing in 1844.</p>

<p>The wood is used in Europe for toys and
other small articles, and experiments have been
made with the sap, and sugar has been obtained
in small quantities.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE ASHES</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Family Oleaceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">In</span> winter there is little to attract us in ash
trees beyond a certain bold strength of
trunk and limb. There is no grace or
delicacy whatever in the branches, the twigs
are coarsely moulded, and the buds are thick
and leathery. The popular prejudice existing
against ash trees in summer, when the contrast
of their light foliage and heavy trunks makes
it less deserved, is fully warranted in winter;
but if the ash is ugly, the wood of few trees is
as generally useful, and its literary history
dates back to the “Odyssey” and to the Eddas
of Norse mythology.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fraxinus</i>, comes from the
Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">phraxis</i> (separation), and probably alludes
to the wood of the European species which
splits easily. There are about fifteen different
species in the United States, three of which
are found commonly in New England. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
green ash, which used to be considered a distinct
species, is now thought to be a variety of
the red ash.</p>

<p>All the ashes have opposite leaf-scars.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White or

nodes. Cross-shaped branching of the twigs
against the sky.</em></p>

<p>The white ash is a tree which we find frequently
along roadsides and in the woods
everywhere in New England. The characteristics
which distinguish it from other trees in
winter are the close diamond-shaped fissures of
the bark, the rusty brown buds, and often the
old clusters of paddle-shaped fruit hanging on
the tree. On some ash trees black, berry-like
excrescences are found hanging in dry clusters
on the ends of the branches. These are not
clusters of fruit, as might at first be supposed,
but the diseased and undeveloped remains of
the panicles of staminate flowers which have
been injured by mites,—curious freaks resembling
oak-apples and the outgrowths of other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</span>insect poisoned plants. Occasionally these
berry-like clusters have been gathered as seeds,
by mistake, instead of the true fruit, a mistake
which does not seem remarkable when the fruit-like
appearance of the clusters is considered.</p>

<p>The wood of the white ash is heavy, tough,
and strong, and is much used for agricultural
implements, tool handles and oars, for the interior
finish of houses and in the construction
of carriages. Emerson tells of an ash which
was felled in Granville many years ago, the
wood of which furnished three thousand rake
stalks. The tree from which I took the following
photograph, stands on a farm in Sterling,
Massachusetts, and measures over fourteen feet
in circumference, five feet from the ground.
This trunk illustrates the massive strength
which gives the ash its one æsthetic quality.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Red or Downy
Ash

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fraxinus pennsylvanica</i></div>

<p><em>This tree resembles the white
ash, but is distinguished from
it by the down on the recent
shoots. It is a smaller tree than
the white ash, more spreading in shape. The
twigs are less coarse and branch more frequently,
with less space between the buds,—shorter
internodes,—on shoots of the same age.
Buds inconspicuous, smaller and blacker than
those of the white ash. Bark closely furrowed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</span>
like that of the white ash. Leaf-scars
opposite.</em></p>

<p>The red ash is much less coarsely moulded
than the white ash, and in its leafless season,
particularly, the contrast between its branches
and those of the white ash is plainly seen.
The fissures in the bark of the red ash seem a
little finer and nearer together than those of
the white ash bark on trees of the same age.
The soft down on the recent shoots remains
through the winter; and this, with the finer
twigs, which branch more frequently, and the
smaller, darker buds, makes the tree easily distinguished
from the white ash in winter,—more
easily even than in summer.</p>

<p>The staminate flowers of the red ash are
afflicted by mites in the same way as those of
the white ash, producing unsightly clusters
which hang on the tree all winter.</p>

<p>The wood is much less valuable than that of
the white ash.</p>

having a less pinched, flattened appearance at
the nodes on the stem. It grows throughout
New England in swamps, in wet woods, and
in moist, muddy ground near rivers. In the
woods its trunk is found frequently without
branches to a great height, and Emerson calls
it the most slender deciduous tree to be found
in the forest. It is sometimes seventy or eighty
feet high, with a trunk scarcely a foot in
diameter.</p>

<p>The wood of the black ash is heavy but not
strong. It is used for fences, for the interior
finish of houses, and, after being separated into
thin strips, it is used in making baskets and
the bottoms of chairs. Its sap was an old
remedy for earache, obtained by holding a
green branch before the fire.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nigra</i>, refers to the color
of the buds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">European Ash

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fraxinus excelsior</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, with a lofty, spreading
head and short, thick trunk.
The bark is ash-colored when old, and dark gray
when young. Very black buds distinguish it
from the American species. Opposite leaf-scars.</em></p>

<p>The European ash is planted frequently along
roadsides and in our parks and gardens. It is
indigenous to Northern, Central, and Southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span>
Europe. Its jet black buds distinguish it from
other ash trees. In the chapter called “A Visit
to an old Bachelor,” in Mrs. Gaskell’s “Cranford,”
Mary Smith tells us how she was talking
to Mr. Holbrook in the fields, and how he
quoted poetry to himself and enjoyed the trees
and clouds and glimpses of distant pastures,
and how he suddenly turned sharp round and
asked, “Now, what color are ash buds in
March?”</p>

<p>“Is the man going mad? thought I. He is
very like Don Quixote. ‘What color are they,
I say?’ repeated he vehemently. ‘I am sure I
don’t know, sir,’ said I, with the meekness of
ignorance. ‘I knew you didn’t. No more did
I—an old fool that I am!—till this young
man comes and tells me. Black as ash buds
in March. And I’ve lived all my life in the
country; more shame for me not to know.
Black: they are jet black, madam.”</p>

<p>The “young man” he refers to is Tennyson,
and the quotation, “Black as ash buds in the
front of March,” is a simile used in “The
Gardener’s Daughter,” and it shows how acute
Tennyson’s powers of observation were, and
how true his descriptions of nature.</p>

<p>The buds of the ash open later in the spring
than those of other trees, and the leaves unfold<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</span>
very slowly. Tennyson also noted this characteristic:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Delaying as the tender ash delays</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">The rare fitness of this simile might pass unheeded
if we did not study trees first and poetry
afterwards.</p>

<p>In Europe ash seeds were used for medicine.
They were called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lingua avis</i> by the old apothecaries,
on account of a fancied resemblance to
the tongues of birds; young ash seeds were
also pickled and used in salads. Evelyn says
the wood “is of all others the sweetest of
our forest fuelling, and the fittest for ladies’
chambers.”</p>

<p>The horsechestnuts, the maples, and the
ashes are the three genera of large trees which
have opposite leaf-scars.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE WALNUTS AND HICKORIES</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Family Juglandaceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Few</span> trees are more lofty and majestic
than certain species of walnuts and
hickories. They are stately in summer,
but in winter, when the foliage has gone
and every branch and twig is thrown in black
relief against the sky, their beauty is truly
imposing.</p>

<p>Both walnuts and hickories are valuable
timber trees, and the nuts of several species
are sweet and edible.</p>

<p>Two genera of this family are found in
America,—<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juglans</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hicoria</i>. Of the first
genus there are two species native in the Northeastern
States,—the butternut and the black
walnut.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Butternut

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juglans cinerea</i></div>

<p><em>A low, spreading tree, branching
a short way up the trunk. Gray
bark, slightly fissured, the clefts not running together.
Recent shoots downy, with a fringe of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
hair over the leaf-scar. Leaf-scars conspicuous,
alternate, the bundle-scars horseshoe (U) shaped.
Light brown buds destitute of scales. Terminal
bud encloses pistillate flowers, which are fertilized
by the staminate flowers enclosed in the
pineapple-like bud over the leaf-scars. These
staminate flowers hang in one long catkin, which
drops off after shedding the pollen in spring.
The superposed buds (two or three over the leaf-scars)
contain the side branches. Pith light
brown and chambered,—by cutting a twig
lengthwise this can be seen,—a characteristic
of the Juglans family.</em></p>

<br>

<p>Among all the native trees, the butternut is
perhaps the most interesting for winter study.
The naked buds, the irregular leaf-scars, with
horseshoe bundle-scars, the superposed buds
containing the lateral branches and the queerly
marked buds of the staminate flowers, the
chambered pith, and the little fringes of down
on the stems, every structural detail of this tree
is interesting and unusual. The butternut is
one of the few trees among the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juglandaceæ</i>
which is not tall and beautiful in outline. It
is a low tree, with wide-spreading, rather straggling
branches, frequently ill shapen and uncouth
in appearance. It is usually associated
in our minds with country lanes, and growing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>by the walls and fences bordering open pastures
and farm lands, and in these surroundings it
seems pleasing and appropriate; but when we
find it planted in parks and cultivated grounds
it seems commonplace and insignificant. It is
found in all the New England States, in New
York, and in Pennsylvania. Very large specimens
grow in the valley of the Connecticut
River.</p>

<p>The wood of the butternut is light brown
in color, it is light, soft, and easily worked,
and is much used for furniture, gunstocks,
and for the interior finish of houses. The
inner bark is used medicinally, and a dye is
made from the bark and nutshells. An excellent
pickle is made from the young nuts,
and the kernels are sweet and edible, although
rather rich and oily. Professor Gray tried the
experiment of making sugar from the sap of the
butternut. He found that it took four trees to
yield nine quarts of sap (one and a quarter
pounds of sugar), the amount that one sugar
maple yields.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juglans</i>, comes from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jovis glans</i>, the nut of Jove, in reference to
the excellence of the fruit, and the specific
name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cinerea</i> (ash-colored), probably alludes to
the color of the bark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">Black Walnut

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juglans nigra</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 50 to 120 feet high,
with spreading branches and
rough bark, darker in color than that of the
butternut. The buds are gray instead of light
brown like those of the butternut, and they are
shorter. The twigs are smooth in winter, without
hair, and the pith is chambered. Alternate,
conspicuous leaf-scars. Characteristic difference
between the two trees is that the fringe of hair
over the leaf-scar in the butternut is absent in
the black walnut.</em></p>

<p>The black walnut is a striking contrast to the
butternut. It is tall and erect, with a broad,
spacious head and vigorous, wide-spreading
branches. The bark is much darker and
rougher than that of the butternut, and the
buds are smaller, and gray rather than yellowish
in color, like those of the other species.</p>

<br>

<p>The wood is heavy, strong, and durable, and
dark brown in color. It takes polish well and
is much used in cabinet making, boat-building,
interior house finishing, and for gunstocks and
coffins. A valuable wood in many ways, but
the passing of the fashion for black walnut
furniture is not to be regretted. It has been
cut most recklessly in our forests during the
last twenty-five years, and already it has been
almost exterminated in the Mississippi Basin.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>Individual trees are now sold where there used
to be whole tracts of black walnut forests. In
Tennessee last year, dealers were buying stumps
of old walnut trees which had been left when
the trees were first cut, in the early days of
the lumber trade. Each stump brought more
money than the whole tree originally sold for.</p>

<p>Its fruit is edible, and an oil is made from its
kernels. A kind of bread has also been made
from the kernels of these nuts, and the husks
are used as a dye.</p>

<p>The black walnut is found growing wild in
the Northeastern States, but it is more common
west than east of the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>The English walnut, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Juglans regia</i>, originally
came from Persia, and is sometimes cultivated
here. An interesting cross between the English
walnut and our native butternut is found
on the north side of Houghton’s Pond in the
Blue Hills, Massachusetts. Only a few of these
hybrids are known to exist, and all of them are
said to grow in the vicinity of Boston.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shagbark; or
Shellbark
Hickory

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hicoria ovata</i></div>

<p><em>A tall, stately tree, 70 to 90 feet
high; unmistakable on account
of its rough, flaking bark, which
shags off in large plates. Yellowish
brown buds, with two outer dark scales,
which also shag characteristically. Coarse twigs;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</span>
alternate leaf-scars. The husk of the nut splits
and breaks off.</em></p>

<p>This is a tree peculiar to Northeastern
America, and one of the most rugged, magnificent
specimens to be found anywhere in
the same temperate climate. It is especially
adapted for broad treatment in landscape gardening,
and should be planted where there is
plenty of room for its full development, and
where one can admire its lofty proportions and
symmetry. It is one among many trees, which
is seen at its best in winter unhampered by
foliage, and then its naked boughs are so inky
black, that it seems as if it were etched against
the sky. These very dark colored branches
are characteristic of the hickories, and help one
to distinguish the trees at a distance. The
rough bark shagging off in curving plates, and
the buds with the same shagging, curving outer
scales are the distinctive characteristics of the
shagbark in winter.</p>

<br>

<p>The wood is heavy, hard, tough, and close-grained,
and it is used for agricultural implements,
axe handles, wagon stock, walking
sticks, and baskets. In tensile strength and
in the weight of compression, a block of
hickory is as strong as wrought iron of the
same length and weight. No other American
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</span>wood burns with such brilliancy or gives out so
much heat as the shagbark. The fruit of this
tree is edible and sweet, and the nuts have
greater commercial value than those of any
other hickory.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hicoria</i>, is of Indian origin
and comes from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">powcohicora</i>, the name of
an oily emulsion made from the pounded kernels
of mockernuts by the Virginian Algonkins.
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ovata</i> (egg-shaped) refers to the shape of the
leaves.</p>

<p>The shagbark is found from Southern Maine
to Florida and westward to Central Kansas.
The forests of Indiana, once the centre of the
hickory trade, are now exhausted. The hickories
are confined to Eastern North America
alone, and are a genus of rare and very valuable
trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mockernut; or
Whiteheart
Hickory

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hicoria alba</i></div>

<p><em>A tall tree 60 to 100 feet high,
with a lofty head. Bark smooth,
with close, wavy furrows,—a
distinctive characteristic of the
tree. Large, hard, round buds, without the dark
outer scales peculiar to the shagbark, but with
downy, yellowish brown scales. Coarse twigs;
alternate leaf-scars. Nut somewhat hexagonal,
with a very thick shell, and a hard, thick husk.</em></p>

<p>The mockernut is one of the most interesting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
of the hickories in winter. Its bark has a
peculiar wavy appearance, entirely unlike any
other member of the family. The hollows are
close together in sinuous, shallow furrows, and
the bark is so smooth over these fissures that
it looks as if the ridges were trying to grow
over and close up the hollows,—the effect is
that of a thin, silk veil drawn over the trunk.
The twigs are large and heavily moulded, with
large oval buds, but they produce a pleasing
effect of strength, instead of seeming ugly and
coarse, like those of the horsechestnut. The
curves and irregularities the stem takes in
growing, and the general alternate plan of
branching save the mockernut from being rigid
and upright like the horsechestnut.</p>

<p>The mockernut is easily distinguished from
every other hickory by its peculiar bark, its
smooth, large buds, and coarse stems.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p5052p" style="max-width: 42.5em;">

<br>

<p>Its wood is used for the same purposes as
that of the shagbark and is equally valuable.
Its nut is large and sweet, and if the tree were
put under cultivation, it would probably equal
that of the shagbark in commercial value. As
it is now, however, the shell is too thick, hard,
and difficult to crack, and the kernel too small
in proportion to the shell to make it marketable.
The experiment of cultivating the mockernut
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</span>to improve its fruit would be an interesting
one, and certainly both the nuts of the mockernut
and shagbark deserve as much attention
as the English walnut.</p>

<p>Both the specific names,—the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alba</i>,
and the English white-heart—refer to the color
of the wood. This tree is found in New England
and also in the West and South.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Bitternut
Hickory

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hicoria minima</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, with a light, granite-gray
bark. Slender twigs, the
recent shoots orange-green and
dotted. Alternate leaf-scars. Buds long, curved,
flattened, and pointed, the lateral ones shorter
and more round than the terminal buds; all
are orange-yellow in color,—the distinguishing
characteristic of the tree. The nuts are bitter.</em></p>

<p>If the characteristic of the bitternut’s flattened,
orange buds is remembered, this tree can
be distinguished not only in winter, but at
every other season of the year. The hickories
are constantly confused, and the fact that they
often hybridize complicates matters still more.
Such an unfailing means of identification as
these yellow buds is, therefore, a great help, and
as there are always one or two lateral buds lying
dormant along the stem, after the buds have
opened in the spring, and as new buds are
formed by the middle of the summer, there is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
scarcely a lapse of time when they fail to
distinguish the tree. The bitternut is the most
graceful of all the hickories. It has a smooth,
tapering trunk and delicate twigs.</p>

<p>Its wood is heavy, hard, tough, and close-grained,
and is used for the yokes of oxen, for
hoops and fuel. The nuts are so bitter that
squirrels refuse them as food.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">minima</i> (the smallest), refers
to the branches and foliage of the tree,
which are more delicate than those of other
hickories. The range is the same as that of
the shagbark and mockernut.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pignut Hickory

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hicoria glabra</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 70 to 80 feet high,
with a tapering trunk and smooth
gray bark, which does not shag. The buds are
yellowish brown, and smaller than those of
other hickories, with no black outer scales like
those of the shagbark, and smaller than the
mockernut buds. The buds are either round, or
egg-shaped. Delicate twigs; alternate leaf-scars.
The nut has a thick shell and poor kernel; the
husk does not split all the way down as it does
with the shagbark.</em></p>

<p>If it were possible for trees to have negative
characters, the pignut would be eminently negative.
In fact, its distinguishing characteristic
is that it has no one distinctive feature to identify
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span>it in winter, as all the other hickories have.
Its bark is not wavy like the mockernut, and it
does not shag like the shagbark; its buds are
not yellow like the bitternut, nor large like the
mockernut, nor has it black outer scales like
the shagbark; its nuts are neither bitter nor
sweet,—and yet these very negative qualities
are a sure means of identification. One knows
the pignut in much the same way that David
Harum knew he had bought a horse, “the only
thing to determine that fact was that it wa’n’t
nothin’ else.” All praise, however, to the outline
of the pignut against a winter sky. The
tracery of its twigs and branches is delicate and
graceful, and it looks as if it were drawn with
the blackest India ink. Michaux calls the pignut
one of the largest trees in the United
States, and it certainly compares well with the
three other native hickories in its general bearing,
for it is as stately and beautiful in outline
as they, in spite of its negative characteristics
in details.</p>

<p>The wood is like that of other hickories and
it is used for the same purposes. The nuts
vary much in shape and size. Some of them
are oval, others broader than they are long,
others perfectly round, and the sizes vary as
much as the shapes. The nuts are not marketable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
although they are not unpleasant to the
taste and afford squirrels a supply of food for
winter.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">glabra</i> (smooth), refers to
the shoots and leaves, which are smoother than
those of other hickories.</p>

<p>The range of the pignut is the same as that
of other members of the genus; it is found
throughout New England and in the West and
South.</p>

<h3>Family Betulaceæ</h3>


<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> birches are a family of exceedingly
graceful and attractive trees, and charm
us quite as much in winter by the
color of their stems and the delicacy of their
twigs, as they do in summer by the fresh green
of their foliage. Like other trees, birches vary
in appearance according to the place where
they grow. If they are shaded by other trees
in the woods their trunks are tapering and tall
and free from branches, but when they grow in
open fields and the lateral branches develop,
their general outline is bushy and far less
attractive; unlike other trees, birches are improved
by not having full development.</p>

<p>The birch has been known from the earliest
ages, and it is found in Europe, Asia, and
North America.</p>

<p>There are distinguishing characteristics in
the details of buds and stems, but the color<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
and texture of the bark on the trunk and
branches of the different species are the most
obvious and certain means of identification in
winter.</p>

<p>There are in all six native species in New
England, and one from Europe which is planted
in our parks and gardens.</p>

<p>In winter, as at every other season of the
year, few trees surpass the canoe birch for
beauty and delicacy. No other tree has a bark
so shiningly white, and even the snow is unable
to dim its purity. We usually think of this
tree as being fragile and delicate, especially
when we recall it as it grows along the edge
of woodlands where the shade of other trees
has forced it to grow slender and tall in reaching
for the light. The canoe birch is really a
large tree, however, and often grows to an
enormous size among the northern hills where
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>it seems to thrive best. The feminine characteristics
associated with this tree in our minds—“Most
beautiful of forest trees, the Lady of
the Woods,” etc.—receive a curious shock
when we come suddenly upon a huge old birch
growing in a clearing in the woods, for all the
world like a middle aged and corpulent matron
among the younger trees.</p>

<p>The wood of the canoe birch is light, but
it is hard and strong. It is used for making
shoe lasts and shoe pegs, spools, wood pulp,
and for fuel. The Indians use it for making
sledges, paddles, the frames of snowshoes, and
the handles of hatchets. They also use the
bark for making canoes, wigwams, and baskets,
and they make a drink from the sap of the
tree.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Betula</i>, probably comes
from the Celtic name for the birch, <em>betu</em>, or it
may possibly have come from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">batuere</i>,
in reference to the birch rods with which the
Roman lictors drove back the crowds of people.
The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">papyrifera</i>, refers to the
paper-like bark which peels off in thin lateral
strips.</p>

<p>This birch is found in the mountains of New
England and generally throughout the Northern
and Northwestern States.</p>

<p>This little birch is perhaps the least interesting
member of a most attractive family. It is
found commonly growing along the sandy
banks of country roads and in waste, barren
places where pitch pines and blueberry bushes
and scrub oaks are found. It is invariably
associated with sterility in our minds, and
seems to demand nothing of the soil on which
it grows, adapting itself immediately to its surroundings,
and thriving where other trees
would die.</p>

<p>Although the bark is white and might be
confounded with that of the canoe birch at first
sight, the trees can easily be told apart. The
gray birch has a close-fitting bark which is
dirty white in color, with triangular black
blotches under the branches, it is exceedingly
chalky to the touch and never peels off as it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span>grows old, while the bark of the canoe birch
peels off in thin lateral strips, is clear white in
color, and seldom shows any dark blotches on
the trunk, The bark of the recent shoots of
the gray birch is rough to the touch, and that
of the canoe birch is smooth and sticky where
the buds join the stem.</p>

<p>Its wood is soft, light, and neither strong nor
durable. It is used for wood pulp, shoe pegs,
spools, barrels, and for fuel.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">populifolia</i> (poplar-leaved),
refers to the leaves which quiver in the wind
and show light under surfaces like the aspens.
The gray birch is found throughout the Northeastern
States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Black or Sweet
Birch

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Betula lenta</i></div>

<p><em>A tall, round-headed tree. The
branches twist in different directions,
but are pendulous and graceful.
The young shoots are brown, dotted with
white, and smooth. The bark is smooth, dark
brown, and resembles that of the garden cherry.
The buds are conical and pointed. The twigs
have an aromatic taste. Alternate leaf-scars.</em></p>

<p>Few trees deserve greater appreciation than
the black birch and few receive as little from
people in general. It is always beautiful, but
in winter when the smooth golden brown stems
are bare and the sun strikes it squarely, it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
glows to the tip of the smallest branch with a
wealth of radiant, living color.</p>

<p>The black birch is easily distinguished by
the dark color of its bark, which is smooth on
young trees and cracks into rough square
plates on old trees, but which never peels off
in strips. Its gray stems have a sweet, spicy
taste, which is also a means of identifying the
tree.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy, strong, and hard, and its
surface after being polished is like satin. It
is much sought after for furniture and is excellent
for fuel. An oil made from the wood
is used medicinally and as a flavoring extract,
and a sweet beer is made by fermenting the
sugary sap.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lenta</i> (pliant), refers to
the flexible stems and branches of this tree.

<p>This is in every way a worthy sister tree of
the black birch, and the rich yellow of the
trunk, but partially revealed through the gray,
shaggy, outer layers of the bark, is quite as
beautiful as the rich red-browns of the black
birch bark. Thoreau felt the charm of yellow
birches. In his journal, Jan. 4, 1853,
he says: “To what I will call Yellow Birch
Swamp, E. Hubbard’s in the north part of the
town, ... west of the Hunts’ pasture. There
are more of these trees in it than anywhere else
in the town that I know. How pleasing to
stand near a new or rare tree; and few are so
handsome as this: singularly allied to the black
birch in its sweet checkerberry scent and its
form, and to the canoe birch in its peeling or
fringed and tasselled bark. The top is brush-like,
as in the black birch. The bark an exquisite
... delicate gold color, curled off partly
from the trunk with vertical clear or smooth
spaces, as if a plane had been passed up the
tree. The sight of these trees affects me more
than California gold. I measured one five and
two-twelfths feet in circumference at six feet from
the ground. We have the silver and the golden
birch. This is like a fair flaxen-haired sister of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</span>
the dark complexioned black birch, with golden
ringlets. How lustily it takes hold of the
swampy soil and braces itself. In the twilight
I went through the swamps, and the yellow
birches sent forth a yellow gleam which each
time made my heart beat faster. Sometimes I
was in doubt about a birch whose vest was buttoned,
smooth and dark, till I came nearer and
saw the yellow gleaming through, or where a
button was off.”</p>

<p>The yellow birch is one of the most valuable
timber trees of the North. The wood
is heavy, hard, and strong, and is used for
making furniture, the hubs of wheels, and
boxes. Few hard woods of a light color make
as attractive flooring as polished yellow
birch.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lutea</i> (yellow), refers to
the color of the wood and bark of the trunk.
The yellow birch is found throughout the
Northeastern States.</p>

<p>The red birch is easily distinguished from all
the other birches by its reddish, loosely peeling
bark, which gives the trunk an unkempt,
shaggy, and torn appearance. The outer bark
separates into flakes which are loose at one
end and adhere to the trunk at the other,
and these projecting strips look like a fringe.
The lower branches often bend down towards
the ground in a straggling, irregular fashion,
while the upper branches are free and sweeping.
It should not be inferred from this description
that the red birch is lacking in beauty,
for it is a most attractive tree. Its general outline
is picturesque, and the soft red color of the
peeling epidermis of the bark in the upper
branches has a very pleasing effect. The red
birch is the only semi-aquatic species among
the birches, and its drooping branches hanging
over the water add much to the beauty of our
streams and rivers.</p>

<p>Its wood is light but strong, and is used for
furniture, wooden ware, and yokes.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">nigra</i> (black), was given
it by Linnæus, the celebrated Swedish botanist,—it
seems to have no particular significance.</p>

<p>The red birch is found growing on the banks
of the Nashua and Merrimac Rivers and beside
smaller streams in Massachusetts, but it grows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</span>
more frequently along river banks in the South
than in the North.</p>

<p>A small shrub (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Betula pumila</i>), the dwarf
birch, found in rocky pastures in Western
Massachusetts, Connecticut, and in the South
and West, completes the list of our six native
birches.</p>

<p><em>A tree from Europe, extensively

chalky bark. Long, slender, down-sweeping

<p>The slender, drooping branches of the European
white birch are so long and pliant that
the slightest breeze sets them swaying in one
direction from the trunk, like a shower of rain
driven by the wind. The birch does not lose
its pendulous grace in mere limp dejection, like
most of the weeping varieties of trees that gardeners
love to propagate, but it holds its head
high and the slender branches droop down,—a
striking contrast to the weeping willow and
other lachrymose specimens of horticultural
art.</p>

<p>There have been constant allusions to this
tree in English literature. Perhaps the most
descriptive is one of Sir Walter Scott’s which
refers to the slender, pendulous boughs,—</p>

<p>From an artistic point of view much has been
said about these trees. In the “Sylvan Year,”
Philip Gilbert Hamerton calls the stem of the
birch “one of the masterpieces of Nature.”
“Everything,” he says, “has been done to
heighten its unrivalled brilliance. The horizontal
peeling of the bark, making dark rings
at irregular distances, the brown spots, the dark
color of the small twigs, the rough texture near
the ground, and the exquisite silky smoothness
of the tight white bands above, offer exactly
that variety of contrast which makes us feel
a rare quality like that smooth whiteness as
strongly as we are capable of feeling it. And
amongst the common effects to be seen in all
northern countries, one of the most brilliant
is the opposition of birch trunks in sunshine
against the deep blue or purple of a mountain
distance in shadow.”</p>

<p>Miss Jekyll, in “Wood and Garden,” says
that the tints of the stem give a precious lesson
in color. “The white of the bark,” she says,
“is here silvery white and there milk white,
and sometimes shows the faintest tinge of rosy
flush. Where the bark has not yet peeled off,
the stem is clouded and banded with delicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span>
gray and with the silver-green of lichen. For
about two feet upward from the ground, in the
case of young trees of about seven to nine inches
in diameter, the bark is dark in color, and lies in
thick and extremely rugged and upright ridges,
contrasting strongly with the smooth white skin
above. Where the two join, the smooth bark
is parted in upright slashes, through which the
dark rough bark seems to swell up, reminding
one forcibly of some of the old fifteenth-century
German costumes, where a dark velvet is arranged
to rise in crumpled folds through slashings
in white satin.”</p>

<p>The wood is used in Europe for fuel and for
making furniture. It is rather curious to find
that the birch has been celebrated as an instrument
of chastisement since early Roman times.
Gerard says that in his time “schoolmasters and
parents do terrify their children with rods made
of birch;” and Shenstone, in the “Schoolmistress,”
has a pathetic little account of the fears
of small boys as they watched the wind waving
the branches of a birch tree growing by the
schoolhouse,—</p>

<p>The European birch is found throughout the
North of Europe, and grows in every kind of
soil, both wet and dry,—the Earl of Haddington
called it, with quaint humor, “an amphibious
plant,” and after two hundred years this is still
descriptive of its habits.</p>

<p>It is perhaps unnecessary to say that the specific
name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">alba</i>, alludes to the color of the bark.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hop Hornbeam;

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ostrya virginiana</i></div>

feet high. The bark is light, and
scales off in thin flakes, and is seldom
more than a quarter of an
inch thick. Small, acute buds; alternate leaf-scars;
delicate twigs. Small catkins, usually
three together, pointing upwards. Hop-like fruit,
often remaining on the tree through the winter.</em></p>

<p>There is but one native hop hornbeam in
New England, and it is an extremely interesting
little tree. It grows under other trees in
the forest, and is easily overlooked, usually
being mistaken for a young elm. Of all trees
the hop hornbeam is the most retiring in its
habits, and takes much the same place among
trees that the hare does among animals, or the
violet among flowers, living a secluded life in
wild places, where the woods partially conceal
its identity.</p>

<p>Its outline against the sky in winter is most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</span>
delicate and pretty, the twigs are very slender,
and are tipped with the three little pointing
fingers of the catkins, and the whole tree produces
a most pleasing effect. Although the
hop hornbeam frequents the woods, it never
makes even a small area its own. It is always
found mixed with other trees, and I have never
seen even a little grove of hop hornbeam trees
growing alone.</p>

<p>The wood is very strong, hard, heavy, tough,
and durable, and is used for fence posts, the
handles of tools, and small articles.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ostrya</i>, comes from the
Greek <em>ostryos</em> (a scale), in reference to the
scaly catkins of the fruit. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Virginiana</i> is the
specific name for the North American hop
hornbeam as distinguished from the European
species, which it closely resembles.</p>

<p>The hop hornbeam is found in rich woods
from Nova Scotia to Northern Florida, and

<p>The hornbeam, like the hop hornbeam, is a
small tree and is found growing under larger
trees in the woods. It is readily distinguished
from the hop hornbeam by its smooth, dark
bark, the hornlike appearance of which instantly
suggests its name. There is but one native
species in New England, and it is much smaller
than its sister tree from Europe of the same
name. The European hornbeam has long
been used for making hedges, and in Germany
the hornbeams are planted in such a manner
that every two plants intersect each other in
the form of a St. Andrew’s cross. At the
point where the two plants cross each other the
bark is scraped off and the hornbeams are bound
together closely with straw. The two plants
grow together in a knot and send out horizontal
shoots in a few years, making an impenetrable
hedge. The hornbeam was much used in formal
gardens for labyrinths, arcades, and groves,
and as hedges for geometric designs known as
“the star” and “the goose-foot.”</p>

<p>The wood, like that of the hop hornbeam, is
hard, heavy, strong, and close-grained. It is
used for small articles, like the handles of tools.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Carpinus</i>, comes from the
Celtic <em>car</em> (wood), <em>pinda</em> (head), meaning that
the wood was used for making the yokes of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
cattle. The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">caroliniana</i>, was
used to distinguish the American from the
European species.</p>

<p>The hornbeam is found growing on the
banks of streams and in moist woods throughout
New England, and in the South and West.</p>

oaks, which have always been more or less

<p>There is one native beech and one native

Northeastern States.</p>

<p>The beech is not so graceful as the elm, nor
so lofty as the pine, nor so stalwart as the oak,
but there is not a tree in the woods so distinctly
lovable. In every detail the beech has a dainty,
lady-like beauty, and among the leafless trees
of the winter woods it is as fair as a flower, with
its clean gray bole, its polished brown stems,
and its slender, pointed, lance-like buds. There
is no other tree with which the beech may be
confused, and its characteristics are so pronounced
and unvarying that there is little difficulty
in recognizing it immediately in passing.
When it has grown up partly shaded by other
trees it has a lofty bearing, but when it has developed
in open ground it is round-headed and
spreading in shape. The beech trees from
which the following photograph was taken were
once shaded by other trees, and show this in the
height they have attained and the absence of
spreading, lateral branches.</p>

<p>The wood is hard, strong, and very close-grained
and is used for making chairs, shoe
lasts, the handles of tools, and for fuel. In old
trees where the heartwood predominates the
wood is red, and in younger trees where the
sapwood is more conspicuous the wood is
white, and these differences in color gave rise
to the popular belief among woodcutters that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span>there are two species of beech. Michaux accepted
this theory, which has since become obsolete.
The nuts are sweet and edible, and are
sold in Canada and some of the Western and
Middle States.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Fagus</i>, comes from the
Greek <em>phago</em> (to eat), in allusion to the nuts,
which have always been used as food.</p>

Florida and west to Texas.</p>

<p>Although the beech stands alone in having
no other tree like it, yet it is extremely difficult
to tell the American beech from the European
species which is planted commonly in our parks
and gardens. The bark of the European beech
is a darker gray in color, its buds are grayer
than those of the American, and the inner scales
of the bud have a tendency towards being more
hairy along their edges; for the rest we must
trust to our intuition in telling the trees apart,
unless we are in the woods and know that there
the only indigenous beech is the American.</p>

<p>From the time of Virgil the praises of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span>
beech have been sung in both poetry and prose.
Passienus Crispus, the orator, who married the
Empress Agrippina, was so fond of it that
“he not only delighted to repose beneath
its shade, but he frequently poured wine on
its roots, and used often to embrace it.”
Evelyn and Cook recommended it, Boutcher
thought that it “hardly had an equal,” Mathews
called it “the Hercules and Adonis” of the
sylva of Great Britain, and among the English
poets Beaumont and Fletcher, Leigh Hunt,
Gray, Campbell, and Wordsworth all loved and
admired it for its rare beauty and vigor. Gilpin,
however, does not join this chorus of praise;
in his “Remarks on Forest Scenery” he calls
it “an overgrown bush,” and explains at some
length his reasons for thinking that it lacks
picturesque beauty.</p>

<p>In Europe the wood has been used for more
purposes than in America, and it also ranks
high as fuel. In France oil is made from
beechnuts, used in lamps and for cooking.
The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sylvatica</i>, is from the Latin
which means belonging to the woods.</p>

<p>The purple beech is a variety of this tree,
which has been propagated from the original
sport found in a German forest over a hundred
years ago. Plants from the seeds of the purple
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>beech have a tendency to revert to the original
green, and to insure its peculiar colored foliage
gardeners perpetuate it by layers. It is a
highly artificial tree, and unless it is carefully
placed in appropriate surroundings its effect is
far from pleasing.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chestnut

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Castanea dentata</i></div>

<p><em>One of the largest of our forest
trees. The bark is dark hard,
and rugged, with coarse ridges on old trees.
Light brown buds. Alternate leaf-scars. Recent
shoots are coarse and channelled with two
grooves running down from the base of each leaf-scar,
closely set with white or gray dots. Fruit
ripe in October.</em></p>

<p>At all times a giant among trees, the chestnut
seems perhaps most remarkable in winter
when the massive trunk and lofty branches can
be fully appreciated. There is much beauty
in the bark of this tree, the fissures sweep
boldly up and down the trunk with broad,
smooth spaces between the furrows and give a
most pleasing impression.</p>

<p>It is interesting to find that the chestnut
is one of the exceptions in nature to the rule
that every tree has an unvarying mathematical
arrangement of leaves on the stem. This
regular distribution of leaves on the stem to
economize space and light is called phyllotaxy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</span>
and different trees follow various systematic
arrangements. When the leaves or leaf-scars
are alternate on the stem, as they are in those
of the chestnut, the arrangement is spiral and
one leaf follows another up the stem in ranks
of two, three, five, or more in definite order
according to the kind of tree. In the chestnut,
however, the phyllotaxy is frequently variable
in different twigs of the same tree, and it follows
an unruly, wayward leaf arrangement.</p>

<p>The wood of the chestnut is light, soft, and
not strong, but it is used for making cheap
furniture. It is also made into rails, posts, and
railroad ties, as it is durable when used in
contact with the soil. The nuts are sweet and
edible and have great market value. The
trees bear fruit when they are very young, and
some Western farmers find that orchards of
these trees bring better returns than the same
amount of land in farm products.</p>

<p>The chestnut is closely allied to the sweet
or Spanish chestnut of Europe. The nuts of
the American species are sweeter than those of
the Spanish chestnut, but they are much smaller.
From a French experiment it was found that
the kernel of the chestnut yields sixteen per
cent of good sugar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Oaks

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus</i></div>

<p>There are in all nearly three hundred
different oaks which have
been described by botanists, and fifty of these
are found in North America, exclusive of Mexico.
The oaks are large trees of temperate
climates, and both in Europe and America few
trees have the same varied and general usefulness.
The extraordinary strength in the great,
horizontal branches, their breadth and lateral
sweep, and the rugged boldness of the trunk
have long associated the oak with all that stands
for strength, duration, and unswerving vitality.
An oak never seems out of place; no matter
whether we find it growing in unbroken forests,
on a country estate, in a little garden, or by the
roadside, it always harmonizes with its surroundings
and adds to the composition of the
landscape.</p>

<p>Oaks are divided into two groups, the white
oaks and the black oaks. In New England
there are eleven native oaks, six white oaks and
five black. The white oak, the swamp white, the
mossy cup, the chestnut, the dwarf chestnut,
and the post oak belong to the first group, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
the black oak, the red, the scarlet, the pin, and
the bear or scrub oak belong to the second
group.</p>

<p>The oak is distinguished from all other trees
by its acorn.</p>

<p>The general characteristics of the oaks in
winter are as follows:—</p>

<p>The upper lateral buds cluster at the top of
the twig.</p>

<p>The buds have a tendency towards being
five-sided in shape.</p>

<p>The bud scales are close and overlapping.</p>

<p>The leaf-scars project from the stem.</p>

<p>The bundle-scars are scattered over the leaf-scar.</p>

<p>The pith is five-angled. By cutting a twig
across, the pith can be seen in the centre in
the form of a five-rayed star.</p>

<p>The leaves very often remain on oaks
through the winter.</p>

<p>The following characteristics distinguish the
white oaks from the black oaks:—</p>

<p>The bark of the white oaks is lighter in color
than that of the black oaks, and it flakes off in
strips instead of breaking away in coarse ridges,
as it does in the black oaks.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p5084p" style="max-width: 43.125em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_p5084p.jpg" alt="">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="center no-indent">WHITE OAK<br>
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus alba</i></p>
<p class="no-indent fs90">Page <a href="#Page_85">85</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The acorns of the white oaks mature in one
year, those of the black oaks take two years to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>ripen, so that these young acorns are found on
the branches of the black oaks in winter.</p>

<p>The leaves of the white oaks have rounded
lobes, and the lobes of the black oak leaves are
tipped with a sharp bristle point.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus</i>, comes from the
Celtic <em>quer</em> (fine) and <em>cuez</em> (a tree), or possibly
it may be derived from the Greek <em>choiros</em>, a pig,
because in Europe pigs formerly fed on the
acorns of oak trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White Oak

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus alba</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 60 to 80 feet high,
with a trunk often six feet in diameter.
The bark is light gray; the twigs
smooth and light gray; the recent shoots light
reddish or grayish brown; alternate leaf-scars.
Small, round buds, smooth and short, about as
long as they are wide. Acorns in a shallow,
rough cup, often sweet and edible.</em></p>

<p>The white oak seems to figure in one’s earliest
associations with the woods in winter. The
sound of the withered leaves rustling in the
wind is peculiarly suggestive of cold weather
and dreariness, and invariably strikes the keynote
of the woods on a bleak December day.
Towards the end of winter the leaves are blown
away or fall off, and then the beautiful ramifications
and stalwart limbs of the trees are fully
revealed. I have often noticed in the country<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</span>
that when one large, old white oak is found
growing in an open pasture, there are usually
five or six more of the same size and age within
a short distance. This may be accounted for
by the fact that in the early New England days
these trees were in great demand for ship-building,
and farmers waited for the most promising
trees to reach maturity before selling them.
On some farms these oaks happened to escape
the axe, and have not only outlived the men
who spared them, but stand for landmarks now,
long after the farms themselves have been
deserted and forgotten.</p>

<p>The wood of the white oak is very heavy and
hard, and durable in contact with the soil. It
is used in the construction and interior finish
of buildings and in ship-building, for making
carriages, cabinets, agricultural implements, baskets,
and for fences and railroad ties. It also
makes excellent firewood.</p>

<p>The specific name refers to the light color
of the wood and bark in contrast with that of
the black oaks. It is found from Southern
Maine to Northern Florida and westward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Swamp White
Oak

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus platanoides</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 60 to 80 feet high,
common in swamps and where
the soil is moist. The bark
shags off along the branches, and the trunk is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</span>more deeply fissured than that of the white oak.
The twigs are coarser than those of the white
oak, often shorter in length, and the stems are
rounder. Short, thick-set buds and alternate
leaf-scars. Acorns set in a shallow cup, often
mossy-fringed at the margin; the nut is sweet
and edible.</em></p>
<br>

<br>

<p>When once the swamp white oak’s peculiarities
are known it is seldom confused with any
other oak, even in winter. Its unkempt appearance,
the peeling away of the bark along the
branches, and its generally straggling habit of
growth distinguish it quite as much in the
winter as at any other season of the year; it
is at all times the untidy member of the oak
family. The branches begin very low down
on the trunk of this oak, and one can distinguish
the tree from a distance in this way.
Emerson says that in warm and sheltered
situations it is a neat and beautiful tree, but
that when it is too much exposed to the east
or north wind it shows the effect by its ragged
appearance; as one sees the tree generally
through Southeastern New England one deduces
from its appearance that the prevalent
winds are those from the east and north.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and tough,
and is used for the same things that that of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span>
white oak is used for, and is not distinguished
from it commercially.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">platanoides</i> (platanus-like),
comes from the generic name of the plane tree
or buttonwood, and refers to the bark of the
young trees, which, like that of the buttonwood,
separates and curls off in large thin flakes
along the branches.</p>

<p>The swamp white oak grows in low, wet
ground throughout the Northeastern States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mossy Cup,
Overcup or
Bur Oak

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus macrocarpa</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, sometimes 160 feet
high. The bark is corky, with
corky ridges along the twigs.
The buds are like those of the
swamp white oak, but the scales are more pointed.
Often the dried stipule or a piece of it is left, as
it is persistent in this species. Alternate leaf-scars.
The acorn is almost entirely enclosed in
a thick cup with a mossy fringed border.</em></p>

<p>The curious corky ridges along the twigs
distinguish the mossy cup oak at all seasons
of the year, and its aspect in winter is unusual
and picturesque, owing to this peculiarity.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p5088p" style="max-width: 53.5em;">

<p class="no-indent fs90">Page <a href="#Page_88">88</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The branches are irregular, the buds are
small, and the acorns are large and enclosed for
more than half their length in a cup covered
with prominent scales and bordered with a
thread-like fringe. Michaux says that these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>threads do not appear when the tree is in the
midst of a forest or when the summers are not
very warm.</p>

<p>The wood of the mossy cup oak is even
more valuable than that of the white oak. It
is heavy, strong, hard, tough, close-grained, and
durable in contact with the soil. It is used
for the same purposes as that of the white
oak.</p>

<p>One can easily trace the family resemblance
between the mossy cup oak and the cork tree
of Southern Europe, which yields the cork of
commerce.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">macrocarpa</i>, comes from
two Greek words meaning large fruit, and refers
to the cups and acorns. The mossy cup oak
is found in the West and in certain localities
in New England. It is found on the banks of
the Penobscot River in Maine, on the shores
of Lake Champlain in Vermont, and among
the Berkshire Hills, near Stockbridge, and on
the banks of the Ware River in Massachusetts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Chestnut or
Rock Chestnut
Oak

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus prinus</i></div>

<p><em>A middle-sized or small tree
usually, although it is sometimes
100 feet high. The bark does
not flake. The buds are pointed,—an
exception for the white oaks. The buds
are long in proportion to their width. There is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
no pubescence on the bud, the edges of the scales
are bleached and have turned gray, the centres
remaining a rich reddish brown. Smooth,
glossy twigs, move apt to be ridged than those
of the white oak. Alternate leaf-scars. The
acorn is covered nearly halfway with a thick
cup. The kernel is sweetish and edible.</em></p>

<p>The chestnut oak is distinguished in winter
by its beautiful smooth bark and by its pointed
buds, entirely unlike those of the other white
oaks. It sometimes grows to be a large tree,
but in New England it is usually middle-sized
or small.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and close-grained,
and is used for making fences, railway
ties, and for fuel. The bark is rich in tannin,
and is used for tanning leather.</p>

<p>The specific name was derived from the
Greek, and was the ancient name for an oak
tree.</p>

<p>The chestnut oak is found on the banks of
the Saco River and near Mount Agamenticus
in Southern Maine, among the Blue Hills and
in rich woods in Massachusetts, and it becomes
more common as one goes south.</p>

<br>

<p>The dwarf chestnut, or chinquapin oak
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus prinoides</i>), is the smallest member of
the oak family in New England, and seldom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span>grows to be more than two or three feet high.
It is found in Massachusetts and in the South
and West.</p>

<p>It is a small shrub of no commercial value,
although its little branches are rich in tannin.
The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">prinoides</i>, means prinus-like,
the name of the chestnut oak, and refers
to the general resemblance between the two
species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Post or Rough
Oak

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus minor</i></div>

<p><em>A medium-sized tree, 40 to 50 feet
high. Buds and twigs stumpy
and thick set with short branching.
Buds very round and rusty. Twig persistently
rough, alternate leaf-scars, the bark is hard
and rough. Acorn enclosed in a deep, saucer-shaped
cup.</em></p>

<p>The branches of the post oak are so thick set,
short, and crooked that this oak is seldom confused
with any other. It rarely grows to be
more than twenty-five or thirty feet high, and
the many low, crooked branches, crowded together
at the base of the trunk, give, as Emerson
says, the effect of the top of a tree whose
trunk is under ground. The leaves of the post
oak are often held through the winter, and they
are so stiff, rough, and abundant that they are, in
themselves, a distinguishing mark. The specimen
in the Arnold Arboretum, from which the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</span>
accompanying photograph was taken, holds its
leaves later in the spring than any of the other
oaks.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy, close-grained, hard, and
durable, but it is difficult to season. It is used
in the construction of houses, in the manufacture
of carriages, and for cooperage, fencing,
railway ties, and for fuel.</p>

<p>The specific name, <em>minor</em> (smaller), refers to
the height of this oak as compared with that of
the larger members of the family.</p>

<p>The post oak is found from Southern Massachusetts—on
Cape Cod, on the islands of
Martha’s Vineyard and Naushon—to Northern
Florida and, in certain localities, west to
Eastern Kansas.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Black Oak

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus velutina</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 70 to 80 and (rarely)
150 feet high. Bark thick, rough,
and dark. Twigs smooth, with a bitter taste.
Alternate leaf-scars. Buds very downy, sharp-pointed,
and large. The acorns are set in a
deep, conspicuously scaly cup. The kernel is
bitter.</em></p>

<p class="no-indent fs90">Page <a href="#Page_92">92</a></p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<br>

<p>The black oak is distinguished by its rough,
dark outer bark and rich yellow inner bark
(which is seen when a small cut is made with
a penknife), and its downy pointed buds. On
young trees as well as old ones, the bark is very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</span>rough at the base of the trunk, and this roughness
extends upwards in old trees.</p>

<p>The round, thin, brittle balls found on black
oaks and known as oak-apples are produced by
an insect which injures the leaf by puncturing
it and depositing an egg. This causes irritation
and an abnormal growth, from which the apple
is formed. The grub which lives inside this
excrescence becomes a chrysalis in the autumn,
and changes to a fly in the spring, when it
gnaws its way out by making a little hole
through the shell.</p>

<p>The wood of the black oak is heavy, hard,
and strong, but not tough, and it is liable to
check in drying. The bark is rich in tannin,
and it makes a yellow dye,—quercitron,—obtained
from the inner bark. Used medicinally
the bark is an astringent.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">velutina</i>, was taken originally
from the Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">vellus</i>, meaning shorn
wool, and was applied by botanists to this tree
on account of the fleecy character of the recent
stems and leaves. The black oak is found growing
throughout New England and in the South
and West.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Red Oak

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus rubra</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 60 to 150 feet high.
The bark is fissured in long clefts,
with broad, smooth places between, giving the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</span>
trunk a fluted column effect. Large, sharp-pointed
buds, with close scales. The red oak
buds resemble to some extent those of the chestnut
oak, but there is a fine hair on the scales of the
red oak buds, while the scales of the chestnut oak
buds are bleached and have no hair. Where the
base of the bud joins the stem the buds of the red
oak are more constricted than those of the chestnut
oak, and the chestnut oak buds seem more
sessile. Alternate leaf-scars. Acorn set in a
shallow cup of fine scales.</em></p>

<p>The red oak is a lofty, wide-spreading tree of
great beauty. “No other oak,” Emerson says,
“flourishes so readily in every situation, no
other is of so rapid growth, no other surpasses
it in beauty of foliage and of trunk; no oak
attains, in this climate, to more magnificent
dimensions; no tree, except the white oak,
gives us so noble an idea of strength.”</p>

<p>It is perhaps, of all the black oak group, the
easiest to distinguish in winter on account of
the smooth spaces between the fissures of the
bark on its trunk, and its pointed buds, which are
much less downy than those of the black oak.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy, hard, and strong, but it
is not particularly valuable. It is used in the
construction and interior finish of houses and
for making cheap furniture.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rubra</i>, was given to it on
account of the rich, red midrib and veins of
the leaves.</p>

<p>It is the oak which is found farthest north,
and it grows in all kinds of soil from Nova
Scotia southward to Northern Georgia. The
red oak was one of the earliest American trees
introduced into Europe.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scarlet Oak

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus coccinea</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 60 to 80 feet high.
The bark is grayish and not

alternate leaf-scars. Small buds, the tips being
half as hairy as those of the black oak, while the
bases are smooth. The acorn is one-half or
more enclosed in a coarsely scaled cup. Its
kernel is bitter.</em></p>

<p>The scarlet oak is the most brilliant member
of the oak family. In summer its leaves are a
shining green, in autumn they turn more glowingly
red than those of any other oak, and in
winter its buds and stems are smooth, and show
more color than those of the other members of
the genus. Its outline is less spreading in shape
than those of oaks generally, and the bark of the
trunk is not so coarsely furrowed as the black
oak’s, nor so smooth as that of the red oak.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy and hard, and is used for
the same purposes as red oak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</span></p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">coccinea</i> (of a scarlet

<p>The outline of the pin oak is not in the least
like that of any other oak after its leaves have
fallen; for while most oaks are distinguished by
their far-reaching lateral branches which divide
a short distance at the trunk, the pin oak carries
its main stem to the top of the tree, and
the lateral branches grow from the trunk, forming
a pyramidal head. In the forests where it
grows in swamps and wet places, it loses this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</span>shape, but even then the branches are characteristically
rigid and grow near together. The
pyramidal shape of this tree, its small, delicate
buds and branches, and the pin-like twigs, from
which it takes its name of pin oak, make it easily
recognized as we see it growing in our parks
and gardens.</p>

<p>The wood is hard and strong, where the tree
is found growing commonly, and is used in the
construction of houses and for shingles and
clapboards.</p>

<p>The specific name is from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">paluster</i>,
an adjective meaning swampy or boggy, and
has reference to the moisture-seeking characteristics
of the tree.</p>

<p>The pin oak is found growing on the banks
of the Connecticut River in Massachusetts,
but it occurs more commonly in the South and
West.</p>

<p>The scrub or bear oak (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quercus pumila</i>) is a
dwarfed, straggling bush, three to ten feet high,
and found on sandy, barren, and rocky hills
from Maine to Carolina. Its specific name,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pumila</i> (dwarf), was given to it on account of
its size and crooked manner of growth.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE ELMS AND THE HACKBERRY</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Family Ulmaceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> members of this family are found
in Europe, Asia, and North America.
Two genera, the elm (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulmus</i>) and the
hackberry (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Celtis</i>), are found in the Northeastern
States.</p>

<p>The elms are remarkable for the massive
strength of their trunk and limbs and for the
light delicacy of their small branches and twigs
as we see them against the sky in winter. The
American and English elms particularly are
really more beautiful in winter than in summer,
when the contrast between the little twigs and
the little branches is hidden by the leaves. The
elms are all long-lived trees and grow rapidly.
They bear transplanting and pruning better
than any other tree, and grow on almost any
kind of soil. If it were not for the attacks of
insects, to which the elms seem peculiarly liable,
no trees would be more deserving of cultivation.
Perhaps no other tree is so strongly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
associated in our minds with the beautiful old
valley towns and hillside villages of New England,
and to the elms they largely owe their
beauty. Three indigenous elms are found in
the Northeastern States, the American, slippery,
and cork elms, and two from Europe, the
English and the Scotch or Dutch elms, are
planted commonly in our gardens and parks.</p>

<div class="sidenote">American or
White Elm

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulmus americana</i></div>

<p><em>A large spreading tree, with graceful,
drooping branches. Smooth
brown twigs; alternate leaf-scars.
The terminal and lateral buds are the same size;
the flower buds are larger. The flowers come
before the leaves in the early spring, and the
fruit, a small round samara, ripens later in the
spring.</em></p>

<p>The American elm stands absolutely alone
among trees for its especial kind of beauty.
No other tree combines such strength and lofty
stateliness with so much fine work and delicacy.
Its trunk divides a short distance from the
ground into many large, spreading branches,
which stretch up high into the air and support
the waving, drooping, curving twigs and small
branches.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>It is interesting to find how many distinct
shapes the American elm takes. These are so
varied that many people think that each form
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</span>is a separate species, but they are all different
types of the same tree. The Etruscan vase is
one of the most familiar shapes of this elm. Its
trunk divides a short way from the ground into
several equally large branches, and the top of
the tree is flat, with down-sweeping lateral
branches. The beautiful Lancaster elm, from
which the accompanying photograph was taken,
belongs to this Etruscan vase form. Another
well-known shape is the plume, which may be
either single or compound. In these trees the
single trunk or two or three parallel limbs rise
to a great height without branches, and these
spread into one or two light waving plumes.
Many of these plume elms are found in the
Berkshire Hills and throughout New England
where the woods have been cut away and the
elms have been left standing. The oak form,
still another shape the elm occasionally takes,
is broad and round-headed, with heavy lateral
branches which extend in a horizontal direction
in a manner very suggestive of the white oak.
This is not so common as the vase and plume
elms, and only occurs when the tree has grown
in an open situation with plenty of air and
light. A fine specimen of this tree stands near
the Pratt house, in Concord, Massachusetts.
“Feathered” elms are those which have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</span>
growth of little twigs along the trunk and
branches. They may feather any of the different
forms already described, and they come from
latent buds which may have been dormant for
years before opening.</p>

<p>“The white elm,” Professor Charles S. Sargent
says, “is one of the largest and most
graceful trees of the Northeastern States and
Canada. It is beautiful at all seasons of the
year,—when its minute flowers, harbingers of
earliest spring, cover the branches; when in
summer it rises like a great fountain of dark
and brilliant green above its humbler companions
of the forest or sweeps with long and
graceful boughs the placid waters of some
stream flowing through verdant meadows;
when autumn delicately tints its leaves; and
when winter brings out every detail of the
great arching limbs and slender pendulous
branches standing out in clear relief against
the sky.</p>

<p>“The elm trees which greeted the English
colonists as they landed on the shores of New
England seemed like old friends from their
general resemblance to the elm trees that had
stood by their cottages at home; and as the
forest gave way to cornfields many elm trees
were allowed to escape the axe, and when a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</span>
home was made a sapling elm taken from the
borders of a neighboring swamp was often set
to guard the rooftree. These elm trees, remnants
of the forest which covered New England
when it was first inhabited by white men,
or planted during the first century of their
occupation, are now dead or rapidly disappearing;
they long remained the noblest
and most imposing trees of the Northern States,
and no others planted by man in North
America have equalled the largest of them in
beauty and size.”</p>

<p>The wood is heavy, tough, and difficult to
split. It is used for making the hubs of wheels
and for flooring, cooperage, and boat-building.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulmus</i>, comes from ulm
or elm, the Saxon name of the tree, the specific
name explains itself. The American elm is
found from Newfoundland to Florida and as
far west as the eastern base of the Rocky
Mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Slippery or
Red Elm

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulmus pubescens</i></div>

<p><em>A medium-sized tree, 45 to 60
feet high. The twigs are gray
and bristled, unlike the smooth
twigs of the white elm. Alternate leaf-scars,
which are more conspicuous than those of the
white elm. The buds are larger and rounder
than those of the white elm; they are soft and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span>
downy, and are covered with reddish brown
hairs. The inner bark is very mucilaginous.</em></p>

<p>Country boys know the slippery elm for its
sweet mucilage, just as they know the shagbark
for its nuts, the sassafras for its aromatic
roots, and the spruce for its gum; and this
mucilaginous characteristic is a certain means
of determining the tree.</p>

<p>In form it is less drooping than the white
elm and it is also much smaller. The hairy
buds give the whole tree a reddish color in
spring, and from this it probably takes the
name of red elm; the slippery elm is a more
characteristic name however, as few trees have
such a slippery inner bark. These hairy brown
buds are among the prettiest to be found on
any trees in winter. Compared with the smooth,
hard buds on many trees, they are what soft,
long-haired Angoras are to ordinary cats.</p>

<p>The wood is strong, hard, and close-grained
and is used for making posts, railroad ties, and
agricultural implements. The inner bark is
used for inflammatory diseases and externally
for poultices.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pubescens</i> (down or soft
hair), refers to the pubescence on the buds and
leaves and along the recent shoots.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>The slippery elm is found in certain localities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span>throughout the Atlantic States, it is not
common in Eastern Massachusetts.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cork or Rock
Elm

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulmus racemosa</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 80 to 100 feet high,
known by the peculiar corky ridges
along the branches. Alternate
leaf-scars. The recent twigs and the scales of
the bud are fringed with downy hair.</em></p>

<p>In New England the cork elm is found in
the northwestern part of New Hampshire and
in Southern Vermont. It is rare in Massachusetts,
and would probably be found only
in the western part of the State growing wild.
Neither Michaux nor Emerson has described
the cork elm. Nuttall says that it was discovered
in the State of New York by a Mr. Thomas,
and he gives the tree the name “Thomas’s
elm,” which has fortunately not been retained.</p>

<p>The wood is tougher and of somewhat finer
grain than that of the white elm, and in the
“Silva of North America,” Professor Sargent
says: “The value of the wood of the rock elm
threatens its extinction; and most of the large
trees have already been cut in the forests of
Canada, New England, New York, and Michigan.
The rock elm is sometimes planted as a shade
tree in the region which it inhabits naturally,
and although it grows rather more slowly than
the white elm, it is a handsome and distinct<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span>
ornamental tree which planters have too generally
neglected.”</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">racemosa</i> (cluster-flowered),
refers to the flowers which grow in a raceme.</p>

<p>It is found in New England, its range extending
southward and westward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">English Elm

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulmus campestris</i></div>

<p><em>A tall tree, more upright in
growth than the American elm.
The branches are less spreading and more erect
than those of the American species. In this
climate it is often distinguished by the little
tufts of dead twigs on the tree. The bark is
darker and coarser than that of the American
elm; the buds and twigs differ very little from
those of our species.</em></p>

<p>The English elm is found planted frequently
throughout New England, and there are many
fine specimens in Massachusetts, especially
in the country about Boston. According to
Emerson, they were originally said to be imported
and planted by a wheelwright for his
own use in making the hubs of wheels, for which
purpose the wood of the English elm is superior
to any other. At all events, there are many
beautiful specimens growing near old colonial
houses, and sometimes they are found growing
by stone walls at some distance from the house,
back of farm buildings and barns, as was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>the group from which I took the following
photograph.</p>

<p>The American elm is more graceful than
the English elm, which, on the other hand, is
more stately; both trees are unusually beautiful,
although representing such different types of
beauty. In the “Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table,”
Dr. Holmes contrasts the English and
American elms growing on Boston Common.
“Go out with me into that walk which we call
the Mall,” he says, “and look at the English
and American elms. The American elm is
tall, graceful, slender-sprayed, and drooping as
if from languor. The English elm is compact,
robust, holds its branches up, and carries its
leaves for weeks longer than our own native
tree. Is this typical of the creative force on
the two sides of the ocean or not?”</p>

<p>In England the elm has been planted from
the time of the Romans, though Dr. Walker
thinks that it was brought over at the time of
the Crusades. The elm was planted by the
Romans as a prop for grape vines, and in the
South of Italy it is still used for that purpose.
In “Paradise Lost” Milton refers to this when
he describes how Adam and Eve spent their
time in the Garden of Eden. Among various
other occupations,</p>

<p>Columella tells us that vineyards with elm
trees as props were named <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbusta</i>, the vines
themselves being called <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbustivæ vitæ</i>, to distinguish
them from others raised in more confined
situations. Once in two years the elms
were carefully pruned to prevent their leaves
from overshadowing the grapes; this was considered
of great importance, and we have a
better understanding of Virgil’s reproach to
Corydon, who neglected both his elms and
vines, when we realize this:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">

    <div class="verse indent0">(Your vine half pruned upon the leafy elm.)</div>

marriage:—</p>

<div class="sidenote">Scotch, Dutch,
or Wych Elm

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulmus montana</i></div>

<p><em>A medium-sized tree, 50 to 60
feet high. The bark is smooth
and green. The branches are
spreading and somewhat drooping. The buds
are not downy like those of the slippery elm.</em></p>

<p>The Scotch elm, like the English elm, is
extensively cultivated in the parks and gardens
about Boston, and it is frequently planted along
roadsides. It is less upright and tall than the
English elm, its average height being about
forty feet, and it has a more spreading head.</p>

<p>The Scotch elm, according to Gerard, had
various uses in ancient times. Its wood was
made into bows, and its bark, which is so tough
that it will strip or peel off from the wood
from one end of a bough to the other without
breaking, was made into ropes. Its wood was
not considered so good for naves as that of
the English elm, though in Scotland it is used
by ship-builders, the block and pump maker,
the cartwright and cabinet maker. Loudon
says in his “Arboretum et Fruticetum Britannicum”:
“In many parts of the country, the
wych elm, or witch-hazel, as it is still occasionally
called, is considered a preservative
against witches; probably from the coincidence,
between the words ‘wych’ and ‘witch.’ In
some of the midland counties, even to the present<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</span>
day, a little cavity is made in the churn to
receive a small portion of witch-hazel, without
which the dairymaids imagine that they would
not be able to get the butter to come.”</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">montana</i>, from the Latin
word meaning living on mountains, was given
to this tree because it is found growing, not
only in the plains and valleys, like <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ulmus
campestris</i>, but also in the remote highlands
where it finds a foothold and flourishes on
the steep slopes of the mountains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hackberry,

<p><em>A small tree, 20 to 50 feet

are lacking, the lateral ones are
flattened and pointed and somewhat hairy. The
twigs are dark grayish brown with white chambered

semi-oval with three bundle-scars and alternate

dark purple; it is round and berry-like and

<p>The hackberry grows wild in Massachusetts,
but it is found rarely and is generally mistaken
for an elm. It grows commonly in lowland
woods in Western New York and the Middle
States, and it can be identified both in winter
and summer by the white chambered pith,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>which is found by cutting a stem of recent
growth. The dried fruit, which hangs on the
stems through the winter, is also another means
of recognizing the tree,—this berry-like fruit
can be seen in the photograph which I took as
late in the deciduous season as April thirteenth.
It is a round-headed tree with a short trunk
and usually a broad spread of branches, but in
the basin of the Ohio River it grows to be a
tall and stately tree.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy and coarsely grained,
and is used for fences and for making cheap
furniture.</p>

<p>The generic name, <em>Celtis</em>, is the ancient
Greek name for the lotus berry; and the
specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occidentalis</i> (belonging to the
west), designates its American origin.</p>

<h3>Families Platanaceæ, Cornaceæ, and Moracæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">There</span> is but one genus in the family
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Platanaceæ</i>, and but one species in the
genus found growing in the Northeastern
States, the buttonwood, or sycamore.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Buttonwood,
Sycamore, or
Plane Tree

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Platanus occidentalis</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 80 to 100 feet high,
with an irregular, picturesque
outline. The bark breaks off in
thin, brittle plates at the base of
the trunk, and higher up it is smooth, an olive
green color, and covered with white blotches.
The buds are subpetiolar,—that is, they are
covered over by the base of the leafstalk through
the summer, and concealed entirely until the
leaf drops off. The leaf-scar is in the shape of
a ring around the bud, with prominent bundle-scars;
the arrangement of the leaf-scars is alternate.
Stipule scars are found on the stems
in some places. The buds are conical, smooth,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
and brown, and are covered by one scale. The
fruit hangs on the tree all winter,—a large,
dry ball made up of hundreds of seeds.</em></p>

<p>Like everything which has a definite individuality,
the buttonwood is a tree which
people either like or dislike strongly. It is
certainly picturesque, and its subpetiolar buds
alone make it unusually interesting, whether
one admires it or not from an æsthetic point
of view. These buds are entirely concealed
through the summer by the hollow bases of
the leafstalks which fit over the buds like
candle extinguishers, and leave scars in circles
after they have fallen.</p>

<p>Its bark has little expansive power, the tissue
is rigid and cannot stretch with the growing
power from within, and it splits and is thrown
off easily. In connection with this, Dr. Holmes
says in “The Autocrat of the Breakfast-Table”:—</p>

<p>“The buttonwood throws off its bark in
large flakes, which one may find lying at its
foot, pushed out, and at last pushed off, by
that tranquil movement from beneath, which
is too slow to be seen, but too powerful to be
arrested. One finds them always, but one
rarely sees them fall. So it is our youth drops
from us—scales off, sapless and lifeless, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>lays bare the tender and immature fresh growth

<p>Gray calls the buttonwood our largest tree,
and Emerson alludes to it as “the largest, grandest,
and loftiest deciduous tree in America;”
while Gilpin says that “no tree forms a more
pleasing shade than the occidental plane.”</p>

<p>The wood takes a good polish and is used
for making furniture, ox yokes, and for the
interior finish of houses.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Platanus</i>, comes from
the Greek word for broad, and has reference
to the wide-spreading leaves and branches of
the tree. The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">occidentalis</i>, was
given to the sycamore as distinctive from
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Platanus orientalis</i>, the oriental plane tree of
Europe. The oriental plane is planted occasionally
in this country, and may be distinguished
from our native species by its broader
head and by the fruit, which frequently
hangs in clusters instead of singly on the
tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span></p>


<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cornaceæ</i> or dogwood family contains
two New England genera. Among many
species of shrubs, two trees deserve especial
notice, the tupelo and the flowering dogwood.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tupelo, Pepperidge,
Sour
Gum Tree

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nyssa sylvatica</i></div>

<p><em>A medium-sized tree, with horizontal
branches and often with
an excurrent trunk. Dark gray
furrowed bark. Grayish brown
twigs, with alternate ridged leaf-scars and three
bundle-scars at the top of the leaf-scar. Small,
brown buds, with overlapping, hairy scales.
The fruit is a small, bluish black drupe, ripe in
the autumn.</em></p>

<p>The tupelo at all seasons is a striking tree,
and is easily distinguished even at a distance
by its flat, rigid branches, growing in horizontal
layers from the main trunk. It varies much
in shape, according to its surroundings in youth.
When it has grown up among other trees in
the woods it is erect and tall, and when it has
stood by itself in open ground it is low and
broad, and almost always carries its main trunk
well into the top of the tree.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy, tough, and hard to work,
and the fibres intertwine so closely that it is
very difficult to split. It is used in making
the hubs of wheels and ox yokes.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Nyssa</i>, is the Greek name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>of a nymph, and was given to the tupelo on
account of its habit of growing in wet places,
on the borders of ponds, and in low, moist
woods. The specific name is frequently given
to plants and trees, and comes from the Latin
word which means belonging to the woods.</p>

<p>It is found from Maine to Florida and westward,
and stands the winds from the sea well
when it grows along the coast, apparently
losing little of its vigor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Flowering Cornel,
Flowering
Dogwood

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cornus florida</i></div>

<p><em>A small tree or shrub, 12 to
40 feet high, with a dark, rough
bark. The recent shoots are
gray and covered with down.
The leaf-scars are small and opposite each other
on the stem. The flower buds are conspicuous.</em></p>

<p>The flowering cornel can be distinguished
by its flower buds alone in winter, if by nothing
else. They are small and round with long
curving tips, and in shape they look something
like the paper torpedoes children play with on
the Fourth of July. This is the only native
tree in our climate, besides the maple and ash,
which has opposite leaf-scars.</p>

<p>The confusion existing in some minds between
the flowering dogwood of the woods and
the poison dogwood of the swamps casts an
undeserved shadow over the name of the former.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
If the poison dogwood were always called
poison sumac and the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cornus florida</i>, flowering
cornel, this unfortunate confusion would soon
end.</p>

<p>The wood is strong, hard, and close-grained,
and takes polish exceedingly well. It is used
in turnery, for the handles of tools, and occasionally
for engravers’ blocks. The bark is
bitter and is used as an astringent and tonic,
especially in the treatment of fevers. The
Indians made a scarlet dye from the bark of
the roots.</p>

<p>The generic name comes from the Latin
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">cornus</i>, a horn, and refers to the hardness of
the wood, and the specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">florida</i> (abounding
in blossoms), alludes to the remarkable
white flowers of this cornel, which open in
June.</p>

<p>The flowering dogwood is found from Eastern
Massachusetts to Central Florida and westward,
and grows under large trees in rich woods.</p>


<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Moracæ</i> are a small family with but one
native representative in the North, the red mulberry.
The white mulberry from China has
been so widely cultivated and naturalized in
the United States, that it is seen more commonly
than the native species.</p>
<br>

<div class="sidenote">Red Mulberry

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Morus rubra</i></div>

<p><em>A small tree, 15 to 60 feet high.
The bark is rough, with long
furrows. The twigs are a light greenish
brown and the leaf-scars are oval, hollow, and
alternate in arrangement. The bundle-scars
form a closed chain around the leaf-scar. A
milky juice comes if the stems are cut on
warm days in winter. Very smooth buds.</em></p>

<p>The red mulberry is not particularly attractive
in winter. In open situations its branches
are wide spreading without being graceful, and
it is broadly erect in shape without being
stately. It grows to be a much larger tree in
the South than it does in the North.</p>

<p>The wood is soft and light, but very durable,
and it is used for fences and cooperage, and
in the South for boat-building. The fruit is
edible, with an agreeable acid flavor.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Morus</i>, is probably derived
from the Celtic word <em>mor</em>, meaning black, in
reference to the color of the fruit. The specific
name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">rubra</i>, is given to this species because
the mulberries are dark red instead of white, like
those of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Morus alba</i>.</p>

<p>The red mulberry is found growing wild
in Western Massachusetts, south to Florida
and westward. It is frequently planted in
gardens for its fruit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

buds are smaller and more rounded than those
of the red mulberry. It is easily distinguished
from the red mulberry by its more numerous
and slender shoots.</em></p>

<p>Professor Charles S. Sargent says that no
other tree furnishes employment, directly and
indirectly, to so large a number of the human
race, or has been so carefully studied from the
cultural point of view, and no other tree has
given rise to such a voluminous literature as
the white mulberry.</p>

<p>It was introduced here from China about
1830, and it has been widely cultivated and
naturalized throughout the United States. The
Chinese were the first to cultivate the mulberry
for feeding silkworms, and they are said to
have discovered the art of making silk 2700
years <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> According to Loudon the discovery
is due to the keen powers of observation of the
Empress Si-ling-chi, who watched the labors of
silkworms on wild mulberry trees, and who first
applied their silk to use. It is interesting to
associate the making of silk with an empress
who loved nature and used her eyes two thousand
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>years and more <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span> From China the
art passed into Persia, India, Arabia, and finally
(350 <span class="allsmcap">B. C.</span>) into Greece. In 1440 <span class="allsmcap">A. D.</span> the white
mulberry was introduced into upper Italy, and
during the reign of Charles VII. the first white
mulberry was planted in France. In 1609 the
silkworm was introduced into Great Britain
by James I., and at the same time he sent over
mulberry trees and silkworms to America, and
tried to induce the colonists in Virginia to
cultivate silkworms instead of raising tobacco.</p>

<p>The wood has been used for making wine
casks in Europe, and is highly valued on
account of the supposed violet flavor it gives
to white wines. The bark is used for making
bast for mats, and linen also has been made
out of it. The fruit of the white mulberry is
insipid and tasteless.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE LOCUSTS, THE YELLOWWOOD, AND
THE KENTUCKY COFFEE TREE</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Family Leguminosæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leguminosæ</i> are a large order of
plants including many different genera,—from
the little clover by the wayside
to the honey locust trees, 140 feet high. The
trees of the different genera are all distinguished
by their pod-like fruit,—the name
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Leguminosæ</i> being given to this family on
account of the leguminous or bean-like pods
which enclose the seeds.</p>

<p>They are interesting to study on account of
the buds, which differ in structure from the
hidden buds of the locusts enclosed in the
stem, to the subpetiolar buds of the yellowwood,
concealed under the leafstalks through
the summer, but conspicuous in winter after
they have fallen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Common
Locust

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Robinia pseud-acacia</i></div>

<p><em>An irregular growing, slender
tree, 70 to 80 feet high, with
very rough, deeply furrowed,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
often yellowish-looking bark. Slender twigs,
with inconspicuous thorns. Small, alternate
triangular leaf-scars, somewhat raised in the
centre. The buds are superposed between the
thorns, and are entirely hidden by the leaf-scars.
Fruit a pea-shaped pod, four or five inches long.</em></p>

<p>The common locust is one of the few trees
which is decidedly more attractive in summer
than in winter. The delicate texture and
tender green of the leaves and the pendulous
racemes of white fragrant flowers make the
whole beauty of this tree, and in winter it seems
rough, straggling, and uncouth in its habit of
growth, and utterly devoid of either strength or
grace. The common locust glories in a wealth
of summer sweetness and color, but in winter
the absence of poise and symmetry in its
branches and its colorless stems make it seem
shapeless and dead.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy and strong, and durable
when it is placed in contact with the soil.
It is used in ship-building and for posts.
The bark is a tonic used in homœopathic
remedies.</p>

<br>

<p>The name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Robinia</i>, was given to this genus
in honor of Jean Robin, a French botanist, and
the gardener of Henry IV. of France. The
specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pseud-acacia</i> (false acacia), arose
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span>from the supposition that this tree was a species
of the Egyptian acacia from its prickly branches
and pinnate leaves, which are like those of that
tree. It was called “locust tree” by English
missionaries who collected it first and fancied
that it was the tree that nourished John the
Baptist in the wilderness.</p>

<p>It was one of the first American trees to
attract attention in Europe, and it has been
extensively cultivated there.</p>

<p>The locust is not a native of New England,
but it grows wild south of Pennsylvania and it
is widely naturalized throughout the United
States east of the Rocky Mountains.</p>

<p>The clammy locust (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Robinia viscosa</i>) is a
small tree or shrub easily distinguished from
the common locust by its stems and young
branches, which are clammy and sticky to the
touch. It is a native of the mountains of
North Carolina, and it has been extensively cultivated
as far north as Eastern Massachusetts.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">viscosa</i>, is from the Latin
adjective meaning full of birdlime, sticky, and
refers to the peculiar clamminess of the stems.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Robinia hispida</i>, the rose acacia, is an ornamental
shrub cultivated in gardens and found
growing wild from Virginia southward. The
specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">hispida</i> (bristly), refers to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
long bristles on the branches, leaves, and pods
which distinguish this shrub from the other
species of the genus.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Honey Locust

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gleditsia triacanthos</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree with a smooth
dark bark, cracking in thick
lateral plates on old trees. Long, branching
thorns growing in clusters out of the trunk and
on the branches. Smooth, shining brown twigs
and prominent U-shaped, alternate leaf-scars.
There are no terminal buds, and the lateral ones
are superposed, inconspicuous, rounded, and
partly concealed in the stem. The fruit is a
large, pea-like pod, often hanging on the trees
through the winter.</em></p>

<p>The honey locust is a beautiful tree with a
large trunk and wide, loosely spreading
branches. It is particularly interesting in
winter on account of the apparent absence of
buds along the stems. But for the rich brown
color of the stems they might be thought dead
until a cut with a knife in the stem over the leaf-scars
shows the little tender buds tucked away
out of sight. It is interesting, too, to find thorns
which are long enough to have little thorns
branching from them. A straight thorn seems
formidable enough even on a rose stem, but a
thorn some ten inches long with eight thorns
branching from it, each varying from half an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>inch to two inches long, and this but one of a
cluster of thorns, keeps the trunk of the honey
locust sacred from climbing boys and from
browsing cattle. The honey locust is more
effective than a barbed wire for fencing. The
fruit is in the form of a flat, crooked reddish
brown pod from seven to eighteen inches
long. These pods are often twisted, and are
carried easily by the wind over the top of
the snow, and young locusts are propagated
in this way at a great distance from the
parent tree. Beer has been made by fermenting
the inner pulp of fresh pods, but it
is more of an experiment than a customary
practice.</p>

<p>The wood of the honey locust is hard, strong,
and durable when it is placed in contact with
the soil; it is used for posts and rails and for
making the hubs of wheels.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gleditsia</i>, was given to it
in honor of Gleditsch, a German botanist; and
the specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">triacanthos</i> (three-thorned),
refers to the branching thorns.</p>

<p>The honey locust is not native in New England,
although it is found growing commonly.
Young trees spring up from the seeds of cultivated
trees, and in this way it has spread and
increased its range. It is found growing wild<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
from Pennsylvania south and west. There are
thornless varieties of this tree which are often
cultivated.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Yellowwood

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cladrastis lutea</i></div>

<p><em>A small tree, 20 to 50 feet high,
with a smooth dark gray bark.
The stems are smooth and brown, with light
colored conspicuous leaf-scars in a circle around
the subpetiolar buds. The buds are brown and
very hairy, each scale being covered with soft
brown hairs. Pod-like fruit, about two inches
long.</em></p>

<p>The clean, smooth bark of the yellowwood,
its delicate branches and rich brown stems
make this tree attractive in winter, in spite of
the fact that, like the locust, its greatest beauty
is in its sweet pendulous flowers and bright
green leaves. The yellowwood is one of the
few trees which have subpetiolar buds, and the
prominent leaf-scars encircling the bud show
that the base of the leafstalk covered it until
the leaf fell off in the autumn.</p>
<br>

<br>

<p>The wood is used for making gunstocks and
for fuel, and it also yields a yellow dye, from
which it takes its specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lutea</i>,—yellow.
The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cladrastis</i>, comes from two
Greek words meaning brittle branches, and
was given to the tree on account of its fragile
branches, which are easily broken by the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>wind. The yellowwood, or virgilia as it is
sometimes called, is extensively cultivated in
gardens and it is found growing wild in
Kentucky and Tennessee. Professor Sargent
says that it is one of the rarest and most local
trees of North America.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Kentucky
Coffee Tree

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Gymnocladus dioicus</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 50 to 80 feet high,
with rough bark. Large cane-like,
smooth, gray shoots somewhat
roughened by prominent lenticles. Large
U-shaped, alternate leaf-scars with three or five
bundle-scars. No terminal bud, the lateral
buds are (two or three) superposed, they are
inconspicuous, very silky to the touch, deep set
and surrounded by an incurved rim of the
bark. Large, wide, thick pods, 5 to 10 inches
long.</em></p>

<p>The Kentucky coffee tree is entirely destitute
of small spray, and in winter its thick, cane-like
stems, without any perceptible buds, give it a
singular appearance of rigid bluntness. A
more striking contrast than the flat, fine sprayed
branches of the hop hornbeam and the stout,
upright stems of the Kentucky coffee tree
could not be imagined. The early settlers in
Kentucky made a drink from the seeds of this
tree, which they considered equal to coffee, but
later when communication with the seaport<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
towns was established they gave up this drink
for real coffee, and the seeds have never been
used since for that purpose, although the tree
has retained its name.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy, but not very strong. It
is occasionally used in cabinet making and for
posts and rails.</p>

<p>The generic name comes from two Greek
words meaning naked branch, and has reference
to the stout branches without spray; and the
specific name comes from two Greek words
meaning of two households, and refers to the
male and female flowers which are found on
separate trees. The Kentucky coffee tree is
found growing wild from New York southward
and westward, and it is occasionally cultivated
in gardens and parks.</p>

<p>There are one or two other trees belonging
to this family which are found planted in
gardens. Of these the laburnum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laburnum
vulgare</i>), a small tree 10 to 20 feet high, is
perhaps the most familiar. It came originally
from Switzerland, and has been cultivated in
our gardens for its beautiful yellow flowers,
“rich in streaming gold.” Another member of
the family cultivated for its flowers and found
wild from New York south and west is the redbud
or Judas tree (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Cercis canadensis</i>). It is a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
small tree with no terminal buds, and with
spreading, oval flower buds along the stems,
which open before the leaf buds in the
spring, and cover the branches with deep-pink
flowers.</p>

<h3>Families Tiliaceæ, Hamamelidaceæ, and Lauraceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tiliaceæ</i> are a tropical family with
a single genus, the linden, as a representative
in our climate. There are
two species found wild south of New York
besides the common linden, the small leaved
basswood and the white basswood, but the
common linden and the European linden are
the two trees found commonly in New England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Linden; Basswood

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tilia americana</i></div>

<p><em>A tall tree, 60 to 80 feet high,
frequently excurrent. The bark
is rather smooth with shallow,
close furrows, and the twigs are smooth, with
a good deal of color. The leaf-scars are alternate,
and the buds are smooth and red, the terminal
one often being absent.</em></p>

<p>The main trunk of the linden frequently
extends upwards undivided through the crown
to the tip of the tree, with small branches growing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</span>
from the trunk all the way up. This excurrent
characteristic of the linden is especially
marked in young trees which have grown in
open situations, but even when the trunk has
divided into large branches, or has grown in
the forest shaded by other trees, and has lost
its excurrent shape, the small branches growing
directly out of the trunk distinguish it from
other trees. The color in the young stems
and buds is another means of its identification,
and in early spring the deepening color in the
twigs from the rising sap, shows that the linden
is almost as responsive as the willow to warm
rains and sunshine.</p>

<p>The wood is soft and white and close-grained.
It is used for carving in the interior finish of
houses, and for making wooden ware and cheap
furniture. Sugar has been made from the sap,
and the inner bark is made into a coarse
cordage and matting, and in Europe a coarse
cloth is made from it.</p>

<p>The Latin generic name probably comes
from <em>ptilon</em>, the Greek word for a feather, in
allusion to the feather-like bracts on the clusters
of the flowers. The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">americana</i>,
was given to our native linden to
distinguish it from the European species.</p>

<p>The linden is found growing wild in rich
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</span>woods from New Brunswick to Georgia and as
far west as Kansas.</p>

<p>The European lindens, or as they are called
in England “lime trees,” may be distinguished
from our linden by their twigs, which are more
numerous and more slender than those of our
species. The linden has long been a favorite
tree for formal effects, both in Europe and in
this country. “The French,” Du Hamel says,
“growing tired of the horsechestnut for
avenues, adopted the lime for that purpose, in
the time of Louis XIV., and accordingly the
approaches to the residences of the French,
as well as the English gentry of that date are
bordered with lime trees.” Since the day of
the modern school of landscape gardening the
linden is not nearly so much planted as it
used to be.</p>

<p>A successful experiment has been tried in
Germany of making table oil from the seeds
of this tree. A paste like chocolate has also
been made from the fruit, but it does not keep.
The family name of Linnæus, the famous
botanist, was originally derived from <em>linn</em>, the
Swedish name for the linden, a large tree
having always stood by the old family homestead.</p>

<p>The European lindens are not so well suited<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</span>
to our climate as our native basswood, but it
seems to be more generally planted in our city
streets, in spite of this fact.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hamamelis</i> family is a small order of
trees and shrubs with two genera in the United
States,—the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hamamelis</i> and <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liquidambar</i>;
each genus has but one species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Liquidamber;
Sweet Gum

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liquidambar styraciflua</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 30 to 150 feet
high, with deeply furrowed bark.
The twigs are covered with corky
ridges. The leaf-scars are alternate.
The buds are reddish in color and smooth.
The pith is in the form of a pentagon when the
twig is cut across. The fruit is a round, dry,
open, rough catkin hanging on the tree through
the winter.</em></p>

<br>

<p>The liquidamber is at all times beautiful,
and in winter the broad, corky wings along
the twigs give it a singular appearance, adding
much to one’s interest in the tree. It is
unusual to find so much color in corky ridged
stems as in those of the liquidamber. The
stems of the cork elm and the mossy cup oak
have these peculiar corky layers, but neither
of them have smooth, polished stems between
the broken ridges, nor such radiant color as
those of the liquidamber. When this tree
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</span>grows in open situations its trunk divides a
short distance from the ground, and the branches
form a pyramidal head. In moist Southern
forests, however, where the liquidamber grows
to be very tall, its trunk is straight, a uniform
size in diameter, and often undivided into
branches to the height of seventy or eighty
feet. Michaux describes a liquidamber which
he found growing in a swamp in Georgia,
which measured fifteen feet and seven inches
in circumference at five feet from the ground,
and these trees sometimes grow to be over
150 feet high when the conditions are favorable
to their growth.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy and close-grained and is
used in cabinet making, for fruit boxes, and
for the outside finish of houses. Professor
Sargent says that the future supply of the
wood is reasonably certain from the fact that
the real home of this tree in those parts of the
country where it attains its greatest development
is in deep swamps, always inundated
every year during several weeks at a time, and
incapable of being drained and cultivated.
The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liquidambar</i>, from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">liquidus</i>
(liquid), <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ambar</i> (amber), was given to this tree
by Linnæus in reference to the fragrant juice
which exudes from its stems. It is sometimes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</span>
collected and used as an ointment in medicine.
The flow of resinous balsam increases according
to the warmth of the climate in which
the liquidamber is found. The specific name,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">styraciflua</i>, from the Latin word <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">styrax</i> (storax),
also alludes to this juice, storax being a resinous
gum.</p>

<p>The liquidamber is found growing in Fairfield
County, Connecticut, and from there southward
to Florida and westward. It grows well
in gardens in the neighborhood of Boston; but
it is liable to suffer after severe winters throughout
Eastern New England.</p>

<p>The witch-hazel (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Hamamelis virginiana</i>) is
a small tree or shrub, 10 to 30 feet high, with a
smooth brown bark and flat branches, covered
through the winter with woody fruit capsules.
It is found on the borders of moist woods
throughout New England and its profusion
of yellow thread-like flowers in the bare November
woods make it a striking object in autumn.
The combination on a single tree, at the same
time, of blossoms and ripe fruit is unusual in
any climate, and the witch-hazel is the only
example of it in the Northeastern States.
Linnæus gave it the Greek name <em>hamamelis</em>,
which means bearing flowers together with
the fruit.</p>

<p>The Indians were the first to use the bark
for curing inflammations, and its medicinal
virtues have long been recognized, in spite of
the fact that chemists consider that it has no
active medicinal properties. On the slopes of
some of the southern mountains the witch-hazel
becomes a small tree, although we are accustomed
to find it a rather straggling shrub in
our New England woods.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Lauraceæ</i> are an order of aromatic trees
and shrubs found chiefly in the tropics; of
trees there is a single genus of a single species
found in New England,—the sassafras.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Sassafras

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sassafras sassafras</i></div>

<p><em>A tree common in rich woods.
It is 15 to 100 feet high, with a
rough bark and twisted branches. Green twigs,
smooth and sweet scented, with an aromatic
mucilaginous juice. Large buds; semi-oval,
semicircular, alternate leaf-scars. The flowers
come a little before the leaves unfold. The
aromatic fragrance is strongest in the bark
of the roots.</em></p>

<p>Few trees are more interesting in winter
than the sassafras. The color of their smooth,
bare stems is an exquisite shade of green, the
terminal buds are large for the size of the
slender twigs and tiny leaf-scars, and the delicious,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
aromatic taste and fragrance when the
twigs are broken are most unusual. The
branches often have a curious spirally twisted
appearance, a corkscrew effect, which with the
rough bark of the trunk give the tree an
ancient weather-beaten aspect when it is comparatively
young. The sassafras was one of the
first American trees which became known in
Europe. In the middle of the sixteenth century
the French in Florida were told by the Indians
about its curative properties, and from that time
it was sought after,—sassafras roots having
formed a part of the first cargo exported from
Massachusetts. J. C. Loudon, an English
writer on trees sixty years ago, had an original
theory, that the discovery of America was
largely due to the sassafras. “It was its
strong fragrance smelt by Columbus,” he says,
in the third volume of his “Arboretum,” “that
encouraged him to persevere when his crew
mutinied, and enabled him to convince them
that land was near at hand.”</p>

<br>

<p>Thoreau in his walks through the winter
woods about Concord in February says: “When
I break off a twig of green-barked sassafras,
as I am going through the woods now, and
smell it, I am startled to find it as fragrant as
in summer. It is an importation of all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>spices of Oriental summers into our New England
winter, very foreign to the snow and the
oak leaves.” This Oriental spiciness may be
partly accounted for by the fact that our
sassafras is related to the camphor and cinnamon
trees of the tropics.</p>

<p>The wood is soft and brittle, but it has
durability when placed in contact with the soil,
which makes it useful for posts and rails. It
is also used for ox yokes and cooperage.
Oil of sassafras, which is distilled from the bark
of the roots, is used for perfuming soap. This
tree is confined to eastern North America, and
deserves far more attention than has been given
it by landscape gardeners,—it is a beautiful
tree as well as an individual one.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sassafras</i> was a popular name used by the
French in Florida, and it has become both its
generic and specific name.</p>

<h3>Families Magnoliaceæ, Bignoniaceæ, Simaroubaceæ, and
Araliaceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> magnolia family is made up of trees
and shrubs belonging mainly to the
tropics, but it has two genera in the
Northeastern States,—the magnolia and the
tulip tree. They are particularly interesting in
winter on account of the buds which are
covered with stipules forming bud-scales and
which protect the undeveloped leaves until they
open in the spring.</p>

<p>There are six species of magnolia in the United
States, but only one is found growing wild in New
England. The tulip tree is the only species in
the genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liriodendron</i> and it is found only in
eastern North America and western China.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Swamp Magnolia;
Sweet
Bay

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnolia glauca</i></div>

<p><em>A shrub or slender tree, 4 to 30 feet
high, with light brown bark. The
recent shoots are a bright green, and
like the buds they have a tendency
towards downiness. Alternate leaf-scars.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span></p>

<p>This magnolia is found growing more or less
commonly in swamps from New Jersey to
Florida, but it is rare in the north. Over a
hundred years ago it was discovered growing
wild in Essex County, Massachusetts, by a
minister of Ipswich, the Rev. Manasseh Cutler,
and it is still found in the swamps near
Gloucester. It is a low shrub in the north,
but in the south it grows to be a slender tree.
The wood which is soft and light is occasionally
used in the south for making broom handles.
The roots of the swamp magnolia are very
fleshy, and they used to be eaten by beavers.
The early settlers in Pennsylvania called it the
“beaver tree” and baited their traps to catch
beavers with pieces of the roots.</p>

<p>The name was given to the genus in honor
of Pierre Magnol, a professor of botany at
Montpellier in the seventeenth century, the
specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">glauca</i> (glaucous) refers to the
bloom on the under side of the leaves.</p>

<p>The umbrella tree (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnolia tripetala</i>) is
found much more commonly in parks and
gardens than our native swamp magnolia, and
it seems a better representative of the genus for
illustration. In the south it grows to be thirty
or forty feet high. The bark is light gray in
color and covered with small, blister-like excrescences.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
The branches are stout, and green
in color turning to brown. The buds are large
and smooth and covered with a purplish,
glaucous bloom, and the leaf-scars are clearly
defined. This magnolia grows in deep, rich
moist soil, and is nowhere common. It is
more frequently cultivated than any of the other
species.</p>

<p>The name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tripetala</i>, was given to it by
Linnæus, and refers to the three conspicuous
sepals of the flowers. The English name
alludes to the spreading umbrella-like arrangement
of the leaves.</p>

<p>The cucumber tree (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnolia acuminata</i>), a
large tree 50 to 90 feet high, grows wild in
western New York and southward, and is
often cultivated. Its leaf buds are silky. The
specific name refers to the pointed apex
of the leaves.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Tulip Tree

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liriodendron tulipifera</i></div>

<p><em>A very large tree, 80 to 150 feet
high, The bark is dark and
smooth, with small shallow furrows.
The twigs are light purplish brown, with
a grayish bloom, and the leaf-scars are oval and
alternate in arrangement. The terminal bud is
covered by two stipules. There are stipule-scars on
the stems. The fruit is a pointed, open, dry cone,
often remaining on the trees through the winter.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>The tulip tree is one of the largest and
tallest trees in our American forests. It has
long been admired for its beauty in the summer,
and a study of its winter buds and stems discloses
the fact that it is equally interesting and
beautiful when its foliage has gone. The buds
are peculiar in structure. Each leaf within the
bud is protected by a pair of stipules, and in
the spring, when the buds open, a leaf slowly
uncurls from its two folded stipule coverings
and another bud is seen beneath, wrapped in
stipules. This bud unfolds and in its turn
discloses another. The process is as fascinating
to watch as the opening of Indian boxes one
within another. This characteristic of the
tulip tree in protecting its young leaves makes
one associate a very human, maternal instinct
with the tree; it seems of all others the most
careful in protecting its young growth. Sir
John Lubbock, in his work on “Buds and
Stipules,” explains that the peculiar squared
end of the tulip tree’s leaf is caused by the
singular way it is folded in the bud.</p>

<p>“I long wondered,” he says, “what could be
the purpose or the advantage to the tree of this
remarkable shape. One idea which occurred
to me was that the difference of form might
enable insects to perceive the tree at some distance,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>just as the colors of flowers are an advantage
in rendering them more conspicuous.
I then looked closely to see whether the peculiar
forms could in any way be explained by the
position of the leaves on the tree. I believe,
however, that the cause is of a different nature,
and has reference to the peculiar character of
the bud. Each young leaf is, as in the family
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Magnoliaceæ</i> generally, originally enclosed in
and sheltered by the stipules of its predecessor.
These are in <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Liriodendron</i> oval or in form
resembling a shallow dish or spoon, so that
when placed face to face they form a hollow
almond-shaped box. Inside this lies the next
younger pair of stipules; and the rest of the
space is occupied by the young leaf, which is
conduplicate or folded on itself down the
middle, like a sheet of note paper, and also
turned back towards the base of the bud. This
unusual position is probably due to the early
development of the petiole. It seems obvious
that the peculiar form of the leaf is due to the
form and arrangement of the bud.”</p>

<p>The wood, which is known as whitewood
and yellow poplar, is very valuable. It is light
and easily worked, and is much used for furniture
and in the interior finish of houses. The
bark of the wood and branches is pungent, bitter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
and aromatic, and acts on the system as a
tonic. According to Bigelow’s “Medical Botany”
it has been used in the treatment of
chronic rheumatism and in intermittent fever.</p>

<p>The generic name comes from two Greek
words meaning tulip tree, and alludes to the
tulip-like flowers; the specific name also refers
to the flowers, and means tulip bearing.</p>

<p>The tulip tree is found growing wild in
Rhode Island and Vermont, south to Florida,
and westward. It is planted commonly throughout
New England. This tree was found growing
in Western China in 1875, and in 1889 specimens
were sent to England and it was found to
be identical with the American species.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Hardy Catalpa;
Indian Bean

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Catalpa speciosa</i></div>

<p>The family <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Bignoniaceæ</i> (named for the Abbé
Bignon) is an order of woody plants found
abundantly in South America. It has a single
representative genus cultivated in the Northern
States and found wild in the South,—the
catalpa. There are two species, the common
catalpa and the hardy catalpa, the latter being
the most desirable for planting.</p>
<br>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_p5158p" style="max-width: 43.6875em;">

<br>

<p><em>A tall tree, 60 to 80 feet high,
with a thick, slightly furrowed
bark. Smooth, gray, coarse,
stiff twigs. Oval leaf-scars arranged in whorls</em>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</span><em>of three on the stem, or opposite each other.
The buds are short and inconspicuous, with loose
scales, The fruit is in long pods, hanging on
the tree till spring.</em></p>

<p>The catalpa is an attractive tree in winter
on account of the long slender pods which
hang from the tips of the branches, and give
the stout stems a light effect otherwise lacking,
for taken alone they are coarse and bluntly
moulded and very rigid. The name catalpa
comes from an Indian word meaning winged
head; and as the catalpa has dense, heavy
foliage in summer and suggests solidity rather
than the light effect “winged” conveys to one’s
mind, it is just possible that the Indians referred
to its winter aspect when they gave it the
name. The buds open very late in the spring,
giving the tree a lifeless appearance long after
other trees are green.</p>

<p>The value of the catalpa as a timber tree is
fast becoming recognized. It grows rapidly,
with an average increase of an inch a year in
the diameter of the trunk, and the wood is very
durable in contact with the soil; when used
for railroad ties it has been known to remain
sound for over twenty years. Its practical
value is shown by the experience of an Illinois
farmer who planted five hundred acres of these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</span>
trees, and after eight years’ growth thirteen
thousand posts were cut and sold for thirteen
hundred dollars, and the remaining trees were
improved rather than harmed by this thinning
out.</p>

<p>The Latin name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">speciosa</i> (well-formed), refers
to the beautiful flowers of this tree. The
catalpa grows wild in the Middle West, and is
cultivated commonly in parks and gardens in
the Northeastern States.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Simaroubaceæ</i> family is a small order
of trees and shrubs found in the South, with
one genus in the North, a cultivated and widely
naturalized tree,—the ailanthus from China.</p>

<br>

<p>The ailanthus, like the Kentucky coffee tree,
is destitute of small spray among its branches,
but it would never be confused with that tree
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</span>on account of its smooth bark, which is a great
contrast to the roughly ridged bark of the Kentucky
coffee tree. Its stems are smooth and
thick, and the large leaf-scars are much more
prominent than the buds. Its large, pinnate
leaves, often over four feet long, make the
ailanthus decorative in summer, but its coarse
stems in winter diminish its æsthetic value in
landscape gardening. It grows very fast at
first, its leading stems sometimes reaching over
six feet in a single season; but after ten or
twelve years this rate decreases and it advances
with moderate growth.</p>

<p>In America it is planted only as an ornamental
tree, but its wood is fine-grained, hard,
and takes a good polish, and is well fitted for
cabinet making.</p>

<p>The generic name was originally spelled
ailantus, and came from <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">ailanto</i> (tree of heaven),
the name of this tree in the Moluccas; its
name was undoubtedly given to it on account
of the rapidity of its growth and the great
height it reaches in its native country. The
specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">glandulosa</i> (glandulous), refers to
the margins on the under side of the leaves.</p>

<p>The ailanthus originally came from China,
but it has become naturalized here, and is
planted very commonly in city streets, along<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
country roads, and in parks and gardens. It
was first brought to the United States by Mr.
William Hamilton in 1784.</p>

<hr class="tb">

are covered with loose scales and are small for
the size of the stems. The white pith in the
stems is conspicuous when they are cut.</em></p>

<p>Among all trees and shrubs the aralia is
unique in winter. Its stout, club-like stems,
thickly beset with prickles, are so large they
never fail to attract attention, and whatever
lack of beauty there may be is overlooked
owing to their grotesque aspect. In our Northern
gardens it is only a shrub, but it invariably
arouses curiosity and seems to compel attention
more than trees three times its size.</p>

<p>The bark of the root and the berries are occasionally
used in medicine as a stimulant.</p>

in gardens. It is seen at its best in the rich
soil of the Big Smoky Mountains of Tennessee.
There it grows to be thirty or thirty-five
feet high, with wide-spreading branches and a
true arborescent habit.</p>

<h3>Family Rosaceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> rose family is a very large order of
trees, shrubs, and herbs belonging to
temperate climates. There are numerous
genera, including valuable fruit and
ornamental trees which have been cultivated
since the earliest times. Many of the species
are so familiar that they scarcely need description
in summer, but in winter the character of
their buds and stems is less easily recognized,
and unless the trees are well grown it is sometimes
difficult to identify them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Common
Apple Tree

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrus malus</i></div>

<p><em>A flat-topped tree, 20 to 40 feet
high. The bark of the tree scales
off in small, thin, brittle plates.
The buds and the stems are small and somewhat
woolly. The leaf-scars are alternate and inconspicuous,
with three bundle-scars.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</span></p>

<p>The low, flat-topped, broad-headed shape of
the apple tree is so characteristic that it may
be easily recognized in winter, even when there
is no surrounding orchard to identify it. So
strong in one’s mind is the association of
blossoms with these trees, that even a bare
old apple tree against a winter sky suggests
the spring,—an apple tree always seems to be
haunted by the ghosts of its pink blossoms.
The literary history of this tree goes back to
the mythologies of the Greeks, the Scandinavians,
and the Druids, and it also figures
prominently in early Christian as well as pagan
legends. It has been cultivated for its fruit
since prehistoric times, and there are hundreds
of varieties of it in cultivation.</p>

<p>The wood is fine-grained, hard, and a rich
reddish brown color. It is used for small purposes
in turnery. The fruit, however, is the
most valuable product of the tree, and cider
has been made from it for hundreds of years.
Its native country is uncertain, but it is probably
indigenous to the Northwestern Himalayas and
the forests along the Black Sea. It was introduced
into Britain by the Romans, and it is
widely naturalized in the United States.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrus</i>, is the ancient
classical name for the pear tree, and probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</span>
was originally taken from the Celtic word <em>peren</em>,
from which the English word was derived.
The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">malus</i>, is the ancient classical
name for the apple tree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Common Pear
Tree

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrus communis</i></div>

<p><em>A pyramidal tree, 30 to 70 feet
high. The bark is smooth, and
the branches incline to be thorny,
especially when the tree has escaped cultivation.
Smooth stems and small pointed buds. Alternate
inconspicuous leaf-scars, with three bundle-scars.</em></p>

<p>As distinctive in shape as the apple tree, but
in striking contrast to it, the erect pyramidal
head of the pear tree is easily recognized in
winter, and its small, pointed buds and smooth
stems offer other points of difference. Like
the apple tree, the pear tree has been in cultivation
for hundreds of years and there are innumerable
varieties. It seems incongruous that
so small a tree should live to a great age, but
Bosc alludes to pear trees more than four
hundred years old, and Knight tells of several
which date back to the fifteenth century.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy and compact, and is used
in Europe by wood engravers and turners. A
drink called perry is made from pears in much
the same way that cider is made from apples.
It was considered an antidote to mushroom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span>
poisoning by the Romans, and in England it is
still taken, “after a surfeit of that vegetable,”
according to Loudon. The pear tree is a
native of nearly all the elevated regions of
Europe and Western Asia. Like the apple
tree it was introduced into Britain by the
Romans, and it is widely naturalized in the
United States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Mountain Ash,
or Rowan Tree

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrus americana</i></div>

<p><em>A slender tree, or tall shrub, 20
to 30 feet high. Slender spreading
branches with smooth bark.
The twigs are downy, becoming smooth and
brownish red in color. Large alternate leaf-scars.
The buds are pointed, reddish in color,
and gummy to the touch. The inner scales of
the buds are coated with down. It has bright
scarlet berry-like fruit, which remains on the
tree through the winter.</em></p>

<br>

<p>The mountain ash is seldom associated in
our minds with apple and pear trees, but it
belongs to the same genus nevertheless, and
has absolutely nothing in common with the
ash tree, as one might suppose. The American
mountain ash is frequently planted as an ornamental
tree, although the European species is
more often cultivated than ours. The buds of
the European mountain ash are blunter and
more downy than those of the American, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span>bark is lighter in color, and the berries are
larger, but apart from these differences the
trees can scarcely be told apart in winter.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrus sambucifolia</i>, the elder-leafed mountain
ash, is another native species which grows
wild in the mountains of Northern New England
and is found as far north as Greenland
and westward. The range of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Pyrus americana</i>
is more limited, but it is found from Newfoundland
to North Carolina and westward.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Wild Black
Cherry

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus serotina</i></div>

<p><em>A tree or shrub, varying from
15 to 100 feet high. The bark
is smooth on young trees, with
conspicuous horizontal lenticels; on old trees it
cracks and breaks off in small, thin, brittle scales.
The branches are slender, rigid, reddish brown
in color, and bitter to the taste. The buds are
pointed, a light chestnut brown in color, with
closely overlapping scales. Alternate leaf-scars.</em></p>

<p>The black cherry may be identified in winter
by its bark and by the disagreeable bitter taste
of its stems,—no other tree has a strong, peculiar,
pungent taste like this. The bark of the
young trees is really beautiful, it is so smooth
and has such a rich reddish brown color; in
some characteristics it resembles that of the
black birch, but the larger, coarser lenticels
distinguish it from that tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span></p>

<p>The black cherry is a valuable timber tree.
The wood is light, strong, and hard, and takes a
fair polish. It is used in cabinet making and
for the interior finish of houses. The bark of
the branches and roots is much used in medicine,
and the ripe fruit is used to flavor alcoholic
liquors.</p>

<p>The meaning of the generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus</i>,
is unknown, but it is thought to be of Asiatic
origin. The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">serotina</i> (late flowering),
refers to the blossoms of this tree, which appear
in June, later than those of other cherries.
It is found from Nova Scotia to Florida, and
reaches its greatest size in the Western forests.</p>

<p><i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus virginiana</i>, the choke cherry, and
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus pennsylvanica</i>, the wild red, bird, or pin
cherry, are two small trees found more or less
frequently in the woods throughout the Atlantic
States. They are both distinguished from the
black cherry by their red instead of black fruit.</p>

<p>The common sweet cherry (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus avium</i>),
the common peach tree (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus persica</i>), and
the common garden plum (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Prunus domestica</i>)
all belong to this genus and are widely cultivated
in the United States. They are small
trees with many varieties and are planted for
their fruit.</p>

<p>The cherry was brought from Asia to Italy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
and from there it was rapidly carried to all
parts of Europe. The peach came originally
from China, and was brought to Great Britain
by the Romans, who got it from Persia during
the reign of the Emperor Claudius. It was
carried to North America by the first settlers
at the beginning of the seventeenth century.
The difficulty of raising peaches successfully
in the Northern States is not so much due to
the cold weather as to the swelling of the buds
on warm winter days and in the early spring,
which are afterwards destroyed if the thermometer
goes below zero. An interesting
experiment of whitewashing peach trees, to
prevent the buds from absorbing heat on sunny
days, was tried by Mr. Whitten of the Missouri
Experiment Station, and it was found that
whitened buds remained dormant until April,
while unprotected buds swelled perceptibly
in February and March. Eighty per cent of
whitened buds passed the winter safely, where
only twenty per cent of unwhitened buds
escaped injury by premature swelling.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Shad Bush; Service
Berry;
June Berry

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Amelanchier canadensis</i></div>

<p><em>A small tree, 40 to 50 feet high,
with smooth brown bark. Slender
twigs. The buds are brown
and covered with slightly downy,
silky scales, and the leaf-scars are alternate.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span></p>

<p>The shad bush is strongly associated with the
rich upland woods of New England, and in
the early spring its white flowers are among
the first to appear among the budding trees
and shrubs, when the streams are full and the
shad begin to rise. In winter there are no
marked characteristics by which it may be
known, apart from its general resemblance
to other genera in the family, and its delicate
twigs, small pointed buds with overlapping
scales, and inconspicuous leaf-scars.</p>

<p>The wood is close-grained, heavy, and exceedingly
hard, and is used for the handles of tools
and other small implements.</p>

<p>The generic name, <em>Amelanchier</em>, is the Savoy
name for the medlar. The shad bush is
found from Newfoundland to Northern Florida
and westward.</p>

<span class="fs80">THE WILLOWS AND POPLARS</span></h2>
</div>

<h3>Family Salicaceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">Among</span> the willows there are so many
hybrids and varieties that their classification
is difficult even in summer
when an analysis of the flowers is possible.
Most of the species in the Eastern States are
shrubs, and I have chosen the only large tree,
the white willow, as a representative species for
study in winter. The genus <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populus</i> also belongs
to this family, of which four species grow
commonly in New England.</p>

<div class="sidenote">White Willow

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salix alba</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 50 to 80 feet high,
with thick, rough bark and lithe
branches. The twigs are smooth and often yellow
in color, and the small alternate leaf-scars
have three bundle-scars. The buds are pointed,
covered with a single scale and placed close
against the stems. The lateral buds are numerous
and are usually larger than the terminal buds.</em></p>

<p>The white willow is really a native of Europe,
but for generations in New England it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span>
associated itself with country landscapes, and
there is scarcely a marshy meadow or a stream
through a pasture with a water course unmarked
by a row of these trees. It seems
wonderful that the buds of willows should survive
our cold Northern winters as they do, for
they are covered with a single scale of delicate
texture, and the little undeveloped leaves seem
perilously near the cold. The soft woolly catkins
of some species,—“the pussy willows,”—which
come before the leaves, carry their
own protection from cold weather, and even in
January, when a few warm days bring them out
prematurely, they look comfortable; but the
little leaves with their single coverings never
come out before the right time, and they never
appear to have suffered.</p>

<p>The wood is weak and soft, and little use is
made of it. The value of the twigs in basket
making has been recognized since early Roman
times, Cato having ranked the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">salictum</i>, or
willow field, next in value to the vineyard and
the garden.</p>

<p>The generic name comes from the Celtic
words <em>sal</em>, near, <em>lis</em>, water, in allusion to its
aquatic nature. It grows on all kinds of soil,
and is widely naturalized in the United States.</p>

<p>The weeping willow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salix babylonica</i>) is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</span>
planted in gardens and may be distinguished by
its very slender, long drooping branches, which
in every limb suggest the sentiment of a hundred
years ago. In allusion to its place among
other trees in landscape composition, Mrs. Van
Rensselaer says in “Art Out of Doors”:—</p>

<p>“As soon as we see a weeping willow it
almost shouts out its contrast to the simpler
shapes of the trees which determine the general
character of all our landscapes or garden
pictures. Yet we see it everywhere, in every
kind of situation.</p>

<p>“In all my wanderings I never once have seen
it rightly placed; I never once have seen it
where it did not hurt the effect of its surroundings,
or, at least, if it stood apart from other
trees, where some tree of another species would
not have looked far better.”</p>

<p>The black willow (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Salix nigra</i>) is the only
one among our native willows which grows to a
good size, but even this is seldom more than
thirty feet high.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Aspen; American
Aspen

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populus tremuloides</i></div>

<p><em>A medium sized tree, 30 to 60
feet high, with a smooth, greenish
gray bark and tapering trunk.
The twigs are slender. The buds are long,
sharp-pointed, with smooth, glossy scales covered
with a gummy substance. Alternate leaf-scars.</em></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span></p>

<p>The aspen is more conspicuous in summer,
when the constant motion of its trembling
leaves attracts our attention, than it is in winter,
although in some trees the smooth, olive-green
bark of the trunk is very attractive, particularly
in contrast with the snow. There have been
endless allusions in literature to the European
aspen, which resembles our species. In a
simile showing the activity of Penelope’s
maidens, Homer says:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Some ply the loom; their busy fingers move</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Like poplar leaves when zephyr fans the grove.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">Again Spenser uses the same simile:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent18">“His hand did quake</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And tremble like a leaf of aspen green.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="no-indent">And Sir Walter Scott uses it in the same
way to picture quick changes of facial expression:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“With every change his features played,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">As aspens show the light and shade.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Gerard, in a way scarcely flattering to the
sex, compares the leaves to women’s tongues,
“which seldom cease wagging;” but Sir Walter
Scott restores the balance in the lines:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“O woman! in our hours of ease</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">And variable as the shade</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">By the light quivering aspen made,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">When pain and anguish wring the brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">A ministering angel thou.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<br>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span></p>

<p>The wood is close-grained, soft, and not
strong, but it is made into pulp and used in the
manufacture of paper. The bark is brittle,
with a taste like quinine, but the inner bark
is sweet, and in the spring it is used as food
by the Indians.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populus</i>, is supposed to
have come from the Latin <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">arbor populi</i> (the
tree of the people), because rows of this tree
were always planted in public places about
Rome. The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">tremuloides</i>, refers
to the leaves which tremble continually on
account of their long, flattened, pliable leafstalks.
The aspen grows wild throughout the
Northern United States and in the mountains
of Lower California and Mexico.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Large-toothed
Aspen

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populus grandidentata</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 60 to 80 feet high,
with smooth greenish gray bark.
The buds are conical with somewhat
downy scales and spread
at right angles from the stem. Slender twigs
and alternate leaf-scars.</em></p>

<p>This tree is quite distinct from the American
aspen, although it is often confounded with it.
It is found much less frequently than the
American aspen.</p>

<p>The wood is close-grained, soft, and light,
and is used for making wood pulp and wooden<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span>
ware. In old times when it was the fashion
for women to wear high-heeled shoes this wood
was used in making heels, as it was light and
best adapted to the purpose.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">grandidentata</i> (large
toothed), refers to the serrations of the leaf,
which are much coarser than those of the
American aspen.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Balm of
Gilead; Balsam
Poplar

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populus balsamifera</i></div>

<p><em>A tall tree, 40 to 70 feet high.
The bark ts smooth and greenish
gray, often roughly ridged
at the base of the trunk. Large
buds with overlapping scales covered with a
sticky, yellow, glutinous substance. Conspicuous
alternate leaf-scars.</em></p>

<p>In the early spring, when the sun has melted
the gummy resin which covers the buds of the
balm of Gilead, one can tell the tree blind-folded
by its sweet, pungent perfume, and even
in winter the buds have this same strong,
medicinal, aromatic odor which serves as a
means of recognizing the tree.</p>

<p>Pallas says that when grouse and other birds
of that family feed on the buds of the balm of
Gilead during the winter, their flesh becomes
imbued with the balsam flavor, which he seems
to think adds to the relish of the meat as food.</p>

<p>This tree grows very fast on almost any kind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</span>
of soil, and its roots extend to a great distance.
Emerson found a balm of Gilead the roots of
which had passed under a house forty feet wide
and thrown up suckers on the other side.</p>

<p>The wood, like that of other poplars, is soft
and light and is used in making paper pulp,
pails, and boxes.</p>

<p>The specific name refers to the balsam on
the buds. The balm of Gilead is found in the
Western and Eastern States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Cottonwood;
Necklace or
Carolina
Poplar

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populus deltoides</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 80 to 100 feet
high. The bark is dark gray
and more broken in fissures than
that of other poplars. The buds
are glossy and resinous, but have less balsam than
those of the other species. Alternate leaf-scars.
Conspicuous five-angled pith in the small stems.</em></p>

<p>The cottonwood is larger than the other
poplars, and in the Mississippi Valley it sometimes
grows to be one hundred and fifty feet
high. The climate of London must be particularly
congenial to this tree, for Emerson
alludes to trees there which grew thirty and
forty feet in only seven years. In England
it is called the black Italian poplar. The name
necklace poplar comes from the resemblance
of the fruit of the catkins to the beads of a
necklace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</span></p>

<p>The wood is light and soft, and is used for
pulp, for making packing cases, and for fuel.</p>

<p>The specific name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">deltoides</i>, comes from the
Greek, and alludes to the deltoid or triangular
shape of the leaves. The cottonwood grows
wild in Western New England, south to Florida
and westward.</p>

<p>Beside these four poplars, the swamp cottonwood
(<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Populus heterophylla</i>) is found growing
wild at one place in Connecticut, and the
Lombardy and white poplars are both planted
commonly from Europe.</p>

<p>The erect, rigid branches of the Lombardy
poplar and its general narrow, spire-like growth
make the outline of this tree so distinctive that
it is easily recognized, even in winter, at a great
distance. The buds are gummy, and the bark
of the trunk is deeply fissured. It is a tall
tree, often reaching one hundred and twenty
feet high.</p>

<p>The white poplar may be distinguished by
its buds, which are not covered with sticky
coating like those of the other members of this
genus, and by the recent shoots, which are
downy. It is remarkable in summer for the
thick, white down on the under sides of the dark
green leaves, producing a most pleasing contrast
in the foliage when the wind blows.</p>

</div>

<h3>Family Pinaceæ</h3>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="upper-case">The</span> larch is the only native Northern
genus of the pine family which loses
its leaves in winter; all the other
native genera are evergreens. There is one
indigenous species, and one from Europe which
is cultivated even more commonly than the
American tree.</p>

<div class="sidenote">American
Larch; Tamarack
or Hackmatack

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Larix americana</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 50 to 100 feet high.
The bark is rough with small, flat
scales. The stems are pliable, and
are covered with knobby buds. The
cones are small, not more than half an inch long.</em></p>

<p>In Massachusetts the larch does not attain
a great height, but in cold Northern swamps it
grows to be a large tree. It is not dependent
on a wet situation, but grows well after being
transplanted into upland soil. Its growth is
rapid, and it is often chosen for “quick effects”
in landscape gardening,—a choice which
is to be regretted for the most part, as few
trees have so little beauty as the larch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>During a brief interval in the early spring,
when the first young leaves fringe the branches
in delicate green, this tree is really lovely, but
after that there is little to attract us in its stiff,
formal outline and dark foliage, and in winter
it is most unprepossessing.</p>

<p>The wood is heavy, hard, strong, and very
durable. It is used for the knees of vessels
and ship timbers, for posts, telegraph poles, and
railway ties.</p>

<p>The generic name, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Larix</i>, comes from the
Celtic word <em>lar</em>, meaning fat, and was given to
this genus on account of the resin produced by
the tree. The larch is found throughout the
Northeastern States.</p>

<div class="sidenote">European
Larch

<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Larix europæa</i></div>

<p><em>A large tree, 80 to 100 feet high.
The branches are more pendulous,
and the cones are twice as
large as those of our native species.</em></p>

<p>The cones of both the American and European
larches hang on the branches through the
winter, and as those of the European are an
inch or more long and about as broad, while
those of the American are half that size, the
trees are easily distinguished from each other.
Even in the accompanying photographs this
difference is discernible.</p>

<p>At one time in England the plan of introducing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</span>the larch into the forests bordering
the English lakes was under consideration,
and this greatly disturbed the poet Wordsworth,
who was keenly alive to the distressing
effects of inharmonious and inappropriate tree
planting. In “A Description of the Scenery of
the Lakes,” he points out the fact that it is
impossible for trees which terminate in a spike,
like that of the larch, to blend together and
form masses of wood; that if thousands to
tens of thousands are added, the appearance is
still the same, a collection of separate individual
trees, obstinately presenting themselves as
such, and which, from whatever point they are
looked at, if but seen may be counted upon
the fingers. He goes on to express his dislike
of the larch in the following words “As a tree
it is less than any other pleasing; its branches
(for boughs it has none) have no variety in the
youth of this tree, and little dignity even when
it attains its full growth; leaves it cannot be
said to have, consequently it affords neither
shade nor shelter. In spring the larch becomes
green long before the native trees, and
its green is so peculiar and vivid that, finding
nothing to harmonize with it, wherever it comes
forth a disagreeable speck is produced. In summer,
when all other trees are in their pride, it is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span>
of a dingy, lifeless hue; in autumn of a spiritless,
unvaried yellow, and in winter it is still more
lamentably distinguished from every other deciduous
tree of the forest, for they seem only to
sleep, but the larch appears absolutely dead.”</p>

<p>Many old stories are in existence concerning
the durability and incombustibility of the wood
of this tree. It is said that Julius Cæsar wished
to set fire to a wooden tower before the gates of
a castle, in the Alps, which he was besieging;
that he heaped up logs of larch wood around
it, but was utterly unable to make them burn,—“<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">robusta
larix igni impenetrabile lignum</i>.”
Evelyn, one of the first English writers on trees,
gives an account of a ship made of larch wood
and cypress which was found in the Numidian
Sea, twelve fathoms under water, and which,
though it had lain fourteen hundred years submerged,
was yet quite hard and sound.</p>

<p>Exaggerated as these accounts may seem,
the fact remains that the wood is extremely
valuable, and what the larch lacks in grace and
beauty as an ornamental tree it makes up in
its merits as a useful one. Thus even among
trees there is a just law of compensation.</p>
